To construct such a pattern, choose the most important cards from the reading and work from the centre out, trying to build the image organically. Place the cards needed for support at the bottom and the cards symbolizing goals at the top. Do not hesitate to introduce cards not found in the original reading if you find a strong need for qualities these cards represent. If you see a need for Temperance, for instance, place it below the centre; or if the reading shows a need for more developed will-power and discipline you might place the Chariot and the Nine of Pentacles side by side above the mandala, as the goal. In this way, you take charge of the reading, opening it to include what your intuition tells you the person needs. Most people consult a Tarot reading for specific information. Those who understand the cards a little more may look on the reading as a means of finding a direction. And those who follow a series of readings will see them as a method of keeping in harmony with the changing patterns of life. But to spend a long time reading cards for yourself and others is to discover many things beyond personal information. We have already seen some of these things. One is people's pessimistic reactions to readings. Another, more important, is the way Tarot readings require - and therefore create - a balance between subjective and objective, intuitive and rational, immediate impression and established knowledge, right and left side of the brain. We cannot create such a balance simply by wanting it. We have to let it grow. Tarot readings can help this happen.

We come now to the final and practical part of this division of our subject, being the way to consult and obtain oracles by means of Tarot cards. The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled "The Divining Tarot"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman

explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'

As the reader becomes more competent the readings will become more valuable. The primary thing we get from any reading is information, but the information can be of different kinds. For people with an awareness of the spiritual undercur¬ rents shaping all our lives the Tarot can show what particular shape these currents are taking at that moment. For others, readings may show the likely developments from some par¬ ticular situation or decision. Look for a new job, start a love affair, continue writing a novel - these are all mundane issues, seemingly far from the mystic concerns of the Major Arcana. Nevertheless, these are the things most people look at in Tarot readings; and in fact they are also the ways in which we truly develop, because they are the ways w'e involve ourselves in life. They form the reality rising out of the spiritual undercurrents. A Tarot reading can help us examine the consequences of such actions and decisions. Tarot readings, then, can give us information. But to act on that information, especially if it goes against our desires, remains very difficult.

The value of intuitive and clairvoyant faculties is of course assumed in divination. Where these are naturally present or have been developed by the Diviner, the fortuitous arrangement of cards forms a link between his mind and the atmosphere of the subject of divination, and then the rest is simple. Where intuition fails, or is absent, concentration, intellectual observation and deduction must be used to the fullest extent to obtain a satisfactory result. But intuition, even if apparently dormant, may be cultivated by practice in these divinatory processes. If in doubt as to the exact meaning of a card in a particular connexion, the Diviner is recommended, by those who are versed in the matter, to place his hand on it, try to refrain from thinking of what it ought to be, and note the impressions that arise in his mind. At the beginning this will probably resolve itself into mere guessing and may prove incorrect, but it becomes possible with practice to distinguish between a guess of the conscious mind and an impression arising from the mind which is sub-conscious. It is not within my province to offer either theoretical or practical suggestions on this subject, in which I have no part, but the following additamenta have been contributed by one who has more titles to speak than all the cartomancists of Europe, if they could shuffle with a single pair of hands and divine with one tongue. 1. Before beginning the operation, formulate your question definitely, and repeat it aloud. 2. Make your mind as blank as possible while shuffling the cards. 3. Put out of the mind personal bias and preconceived ideas as far as possible, or your judgment will be tinctured thereby. 4. On this account it is more easy to divine correctly for a stranger

Tarot readings make us aware of the wonderful variety of human nature. As the same cards come up in endless different combinations it becomes clear that people can always produce something new. At the same time, the newness will always come on top of underlying patterns. Through readings we learn in general the ways in which the past affects people, the ways in which their hopes and fears help create the future. But specific past situations and future expections - these will always surprise us. Here again we learn the habit of paying attention. For if we start interpreting the cards automatically on the basis of authoritative books or past readings then we lose the truth, and the readings become shallow and confused. Keep a book of past readings, yes, but not simply to use it as examples for future work. Instead, the book can help remind us of the variety and the constant newness of human behaviour. Notice that, as in creating balance, the Tarot does not simply help us to pay attention. It forces us to do so if we want our readings to produce good results. Tarot readings act as a kind of psychic exercise programme which strengthens the perceptive muscles. What people do with the information they get from Tarot readings teaches us some important lessons about free will. Many people look on the question of free will as an absolute. Either we make constant choices or we act according to destiny. To give it a more modern context, do we do what we do as a deliberate choice at that moment, or as a result of a In terms of Tarot this becomes a practical question. If 1 act freely at any moment, then how can the cards predict what I will do? What meaning

The Tarot teaches us as well the valuable lesson of context. No matter how absolute a quality may seem to us in the abstract, in reality it affects us only in the context of other influences. Readings demonstrate this fact in a practical way, as with the woman trying to deal with her lover’s jealousy. A card usually thought of as positive, the Sun, actually tended towards a bad result, for by hoping for the Sun she did not face the needs of the situation, and in fact allowed other people’s ideas to dictate what she wanted. Along with context we learn the ways in which the elements of life balance each other. We see first of all how the suits and specific cards combine to form a unified situation with no suit better or worse than any of the others. Astrologers often find that clients hope for certain signs and elements to dominate their charts, and will show disappointment or even shame if others appear. Similarly, for some people who know a little about Tarot, if a reading shows a lot of Wands, or Cups, they will feel comfor¬ ted; if it showed Swords they will become frightened; and if it shows Fentacles they will think of it as trivial, even insulting. Some will only accept a reading which contains many Major cards, because only the trumps, with their implications of power and spiritual awareness, appear important to them. But even the Major Arcana forms only one element, meaningless without the others. We study it in isolation for its wisdom and powerful description of existence. But in practice we need to mix the spiritual with the mundane, the happy with the sad, love and anger together to understand the world.

If any device will provide meaning, why Tarot? The answer is, any system will tell us something, but the quality of that something depends on the values contained in the system. The Tarot contains a philosophy, an outline of how human con¬ sciousness evolves, and a vast compendium of human experience. Shuffling the cards brings all these values into play with each other. We might argue that assigning a philosophy to the cards destroys their objectivity in terms of predicting events. Human values and interpretations have intruded in an otherwise.pure system. Such an idea, I think, would come from a misunder¬ standing of ‘objectivity’. The Tarot is objective because it bypasses conscious decision, but it is not impartial. On the contrary, it attempts to push us in certain directions: optimism, spirituality, a belief in the necessity and value of change. The meanings for the cards given in this book leave a good deal of room for interpretation by the reader. In fact, they require it. This is because the practised reader brings far more to her or his work than a detailed knowledge of the cards and their traditional meanings. Just as important is sensitivity - both to the pictures and to the person sitting there nervously and excitedly staring at the cards. A good reader does not simply repeat traditional fixed meanings. Rather, he or she will find new meanings and interpretations, will extend the patterns. While some people desire objective readings and dislike interpretation, others argue that a reader should not use any definite meanings at all, but always work from ‘feeling' the pictures at the moment. Yet to do so will limit the reader to the narrow range of his or her own perceptions. And those perceptions will always come at least partly from his or her

In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart

Many people today still believe the Romany invented Tarot, despite clear evidence to the contrary. The connection between the two remains so strong that many women wishing to read professionally will dress in bright scarves and flounc¬ ing skirts and gold earrings (balloon pants and brocaded vests and one earring for men) and take names like ‘Madam Sosostris’ in order to satisfy the public. The long association of Tarot reading with cheap theatricals probably explains, at least in part, the contempt or lack of interest many Tarot students have shown towards divination. Seeing the Tarot as both a diagram and a tool of conscious evolution, occultists and esotericists will automatically dismiss the use of the cards to usher in ‘tall dark strangers’ or mysterious inheritances. And yet, by seeing only the abuse and not the deeper possibilities in readings, these occultists have themselves limited the Tarot's true value. Here is Arthur Edward Waite commenting on divination in his book The Pictorial Key to the Tarot: ‘The allocation of a fortune-telling aspect to these cards is the story of a prolonged impertinence.’ This brings us to an interesting paradox. Because they looked down on fortune-telling, Waite and others have extended the misuse of readings. The derogatory- way in which they wrote about it has fixed in many people’s minds the image of trivial attempts to predict the future. As to why they wrote of it at all, we can only guess that they or their publishers assumed the public demanded such an approach. After all, even today most people who pick up a book on Tarot care more about mysterious messages than they do about achieving psychic transformation. Certainly the best-selling Tarot books give the simplest formulas for the cards' meanings - and at the same time promise all knowledge.

Today, most people see the Tarot as a means of fortune-telling, or ‘divination’. Strangely, we know less historically about this aspect of the cards than any other. Judging by the comparatively few historical references to divination as opposed to gambling, the practice did not become common until some time after the introduction of the cards themselves. Possibly the Romany, or ‘gypsies’, came across the game of Tarocchi on their travels in Europe and decided to use the cards for fortune-telling. Or individuals developed the concept (the earliest written references are individual interpretations, though they might have derived from some earlier system, not written down but in general use) and the Romany took it from them. People used to believe that the Romany themselves brought the cards from Egypt. The fact is, the Romany probably came from India, and they arrived in Spain a good hundred years after Tarot cards were introduced in Italy and France. In the section on readings we will consider just what divination does, and how such an outrageous practice could possibly work. Here we can simply observe that people can and have told fortunes with anything - the smoky innards of slaughtered beasts, bird patterns across the sky, coloured stones, tossed coins, anything. The practice stems from the simple desire to know, in advance, what is going to happen, and more subtly, from the inner conviction that everything is connected, everything has meaning and that nothing occurs at random.

More important than why they bothered to write about it is the simple fact that few esotericists have done much to dispel the image of divination as trivial. This disregard has even extended to the entire Minor Arcana. Because the Minor cards are associated with readings many serious books on Tarot treat them very lightly, if at all (White's remark applied only to the Major cards). Paul Foster Case's book The Tarot gives only the barest formulas in a kind of appendix at the back. Many others treat only the Major cards. Almost alone of modern esoteric studies Crowley’s The Book Of Thoth goes deeply into the Minor cards, linking them to a complex astrological system. As for methods of doing readings, the most important esoteric studies have given only the barest information, a few ‘spreads’ or designs for laying out the cards, with formula explanations for the different positions. Again, Crowley is the exception, presenting a characteristically complicated system of readings via an astrological ‘clock'. The impact of depth psychology and humanistic astrology has led many contemporary writers to seek a more serious use of divination. Unfortunately, by treating readings in such an offhand manner, the earlier writers have created a tradition of formulas which modern writers have found hard to shake off. Thus we still find the same sorts of explanations for the Minor cards, such as ‘All is not yet lost; good fortune is still possible’ (Douglas); and the same brief descriptions of spreads, with

The cards teach yet another balance, one hinted at in the scales of justice. How does the past relate to the future possibilities? How do we combine the effects of our own decision with the influences of the outside world ? What do we mean when we say we take responsibility for our lives? Does it mean we create or control everything that happens to us? As in the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ sibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us entirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot readings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any moment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a very short person cannot expect to become a professional basketball player, so that same person must not consider his whole life dominated by height. People who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which counts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one really controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the meaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some readings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly dominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the determining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ ticular situation. Tarot readings help us develop confidence in our own perceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, and partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. Which of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case? Does a court card apply to the subject, some other person, or an abstract principle, such as the King of Swords signifying law and authority, or the Queen of Cups creativity? As we read more we find ourselves starting to sense the answers to these and

The most direct way to bring in an outside influence involves simple suggestions. If the reading indicates a need for the grounding influence of Pentacles, the subject can try doing more physical things, such as sports or gardening, or paying more attention to more mundane activities, such as work or study or keeping busy around the house. If the reading shows a need for the watery qualities of Cups, then the reader may emphasize the person’s dreams and fantasies, and may suggest activities such as meditation or drawing. A person can fill a need for Wands by becoming more active physically, competing with other people, or starting new projects. And a need for Swords would call for a sober, carefully thought out approach to the person’s situation. The important thing about these recommendations is that they reach beyond the reading. They deal with the cards that do not appear as well as the ones that do. Therefore, beginning readers should use this method carefully, lest they assume too much knowledge and control on their part. So far, we have considered practical responses to the informa¬ tion gained from a reading. But a Tarot reading is not the words describing it; it is rather a series of pictures. And the most direct response to a reading depends on working with the pictures themselves. For people who know the cards well, or for people with some experience in meditation, it becomes possible to work directly with the images to help bring about the effects associated with that card. There is nothing vague or mysterious about this process. It requires concentration as well as instinctive feeling, and it does not replace practical steps. On the contrary, it helps to make those steps more accessible. For if the card Strength appears in a reading

Along with coherency comes the need for a positive approach. It is not enough to depict things as they are. The person wants to know what to do, what not to do. If the cards show something good, the subject still needs to know how to help this along. And if they show' disaster the reader must say so, but can also say what, if anything, the person can do. What brings about this unpleasant Outcome? Can these influences be altered or avoided? How can the person coun¬ teract, or at least cushion it? What elements show other possibilities? Can we look for anything good to come out of it? If the Outcome arises from some particular course of action, should the person abandon it? When we do a Tarot reading for someone we take on the responsibility of trying to send that person in a positive direction. Beyond specific suggestions of do this rather than that, lies a wider area of possible action derived from the ways the suits balance each other. In the introduction to each suit we con¬ sidered its problems and the way we could ‘add’ other suits/ elements. In practice, this adding is often difficult to achieve, because it means breaking the pattern shown in the reading itself. For this very reason, however, it is worth trying in situa¬ tions where the reading shows a dead end if the person stays with the elements given.

takes experience and a strong feeling for the cards to help indicate the correct interpretation. Even very practised readers will often find the alternatives confusing. After the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the person is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her to empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on the Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question I ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out loud to fix it more firmly in the mind. The method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must be thorough and some of the cards must become turned around to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I sometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor (many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they use to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all around, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person to bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this method carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ sents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible combinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck bears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ tering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back together, it carries the new pattern. With the cards mixed the subject must separate them into three piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she must remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then from that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down on the left.

The cards are then read in succession, from right to left throughout, beginning at card No. 1 of the top line, the last to be read being that on the extreme left, or No. 7, of the bottom line. This method is recommended when no definite question is asked-that is, when the Querent wishes to learn generally concerning the course of his life and destiny. If he wishes to know what may befall within a certain time, this time should be clearly specified before the cards are shuffled. With further reference to the reading, it should be remembered that the cards must be interpreted relatively to the subject, which means that all official and conventional meanings of the cards may and should be adapted to harmonize with the conditions of this particular case in question--the position, time of life and sex of the Querent, or person for whom the consultation is made. Thus, the Fool may indicate the whole range of mental phases between mere excitement and madness, but the particular phase in each divination must be judged by considering the general trend of the cards, and in this naturally the intuitive faculty plays an important part. It is well, at the beginning of a reading, to run through the cards quickly, so that the mind may receive a general impression of the subject-the trend of the destiny--and afterwards to start again--reading them one by one and interpreting in detail. It should be remembered that the Trumps represent more powerful and compelling forces--by the Tarot hypothesis--than are referable to the small cards.

The very idea of randomness is really very modern. It developed out of the dogma that cause and effect is the only valid connection between two events. Events without this logical joining are random, that is, meaningless. Previously, however, people thought in terms of ‘correspondences’. Events or patterns in one area of existence corresponded to patterns in other areas. The pattern of the zodiac corresponds to the pattern of a person’s life. The pattern of tea leaves in the bottom of a cup corresponds to the outcome of a battle. Everything is connected. The idea has always claimed its adherents, and recently even some scientists, impressed by the way events will occur in series (like a ‘run of bad luck’), have begun to look seriously at it. If we can use anything for fortune-telling why use the Tarot? The answer is, that any system will tell us something ; the value of that something depends on the inherent wisdom of the system. Because the Tarot pictures carry deep significance all by themselves, the patterns they form in readings can teach us a great deal about ourselves, and life in general. Unfortunately, most diviners over the years have ignored these deeper meanings, preferring simple formulas (‘a dark man, one disposed to help the querent’), easily interpreted and quickly digested by the client. The formula meanings are often contradictory as well as blunt, with no indications of how to choose between them. This situation holds true especially for the Minor Arcana which is the bulk of the deck. Almost no works on the Tarot have treated this subject fully. Most serious studies, those which deal with the deep meanings of the Major Arcana, either do not mention the Minor cards at all, or simply throw in another set of formulas at the

We can think up endless dodges to deny the validity of Tarot readings. On one level we tell ourselves, 1 It’s only a pack of cards.’ But even those who do not dismiss the Tarot’s pre¬ dictions so easily may think, ‘Now that I know what it says I can make sure it won’t work out that way.’ Around the time I first began to use Tarot cards I consulted them on something I wanted to do but recognized was dangerous. The cards indicated disaster and spelled out quite clear the shape that disaster would take. I then said to myself, ‘Well, now that I’ve seen the dangers I can make sure I avoid them.’ I went ahead with what I wanted to do, and the situation worked out, in detail, the way the cards had predicted. Not having learned my lesson I read the cards again, hoping not for the truth, but for some reassuring message. I was using a book of meanings at that time, and when I looked up the Basis card the book gave as an interpretation, ‘Failure to follow' good advice’. The problem with making a decision based on a Tarot reading is that we never know how it would have turned out otherwise. Suppose a student considers leaving college and the cards advise strongly against it. If she follows the reading she will never know w'hat might have happened if she had followed her desire instead. Of course the whole point of the reading is that it does tell her what would have happened. But, she will always wonder, suppose it was not true? A prediction, especially from a pack of cards, can never carry the same impact as actual experience. Curiosity alone can make us do disastrous things.

Some books advise readers never to read for themselves because of the lack of objectivity. For a long time I went to a friend for readings and she to me, because neither of us trusted ourselves to interpret our own cards honestly. When I started doing my own readings I still found it hard to overcome various mental tricks to avoid unpleasant images. My favourite worked as follows: I could not ignore the cards I did not like or simply declare them untrue or exaggerated. That would have seemed too obvious. Therefore I looked in the reading for some very positive image, such as the Ace of Cups, and said to myself, ‘Well, that can't be true, nothing so good could come out of this mess.’ And then I would dismiss the whole reading on the grounds that if this one card made no sense none of the others did. Another trick I discovered myself doing was to lay out the cards very casually, so if something bad came up I could think, ‘Well, I didn't really mean it, I didn’t do it seriously.' I could only read for myself when I began treating the readings in the same way I would anyone else’s, mixing the cards carefully, working at the images, trying to get some direction for action (or inaction). A reading will not always give a clear yes or no answer to a question. It may show simply a complex of trends and influences. Sometimes the reading does not involve a choice because of an ongoing situation which cannot easily be avoided. Then specific images and meanings become very important. The Tarot can help us pinpoint the important elements in the situation, the ones that need the most work to change, or bring about, the predicted outcome. People
