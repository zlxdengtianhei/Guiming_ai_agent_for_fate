Knowing this consciously can put us on the way to overcom¬ ing it. Or maybe the cards will show us someone else’s jealousy or vindictiveness; we can then take steps to free our¬ selves from that person's influence. Or, if the cards show love and support from someone, w’e know' we can trust that person. All these things require some sort of response to make them real. We cannot expect to make use of a person’s friendship if we do not make ourselves open to it. Wherever possible the reader should try to point out to the subject definite steps w'hich can be taken to make best use of the information. If the reader cannot recommend a concrete course of action then he or she should point out what area the subject needs to work on. Above all, the reader must learn to form a coherent pattern from the reading. Often, beginning readers will learn the cards and advance to the point where they can skilfully interpret each image in its specific position. At the end the subject finds him or herself with a jumble of different points and no clear idea of how' it all fits together. A good reader can sum up what the reading says in a few sentences. Usually I will try to do this at both the beginning and end of the reading, impressing on the subject’s mind the most important points. Does the Environment support or hinder? Do the person’s Expectations help or hurt? Will the Outcome bring a valuable Result? The subject needs these questions answered, not just in all their complexity, but also in as",

        "text": "To construct such a pattern, choose the most important cards from the reading and work from the centre out, trying to build the image organically. Place the cards needed for support at the bottom and the cards symbolizing goals at the top. Do not hesitate to introduce cards not found in the original reading if you find a strong need for qualities these cards represent. If you see a need for Temperance, for instance, place it below the centre; or if the reading shows a need for more developed will-power and discipline you might place the Chariot and the Nine of Pentacles side by side above the mandala, as the goal. In this way, you take charge of the reading, opening it to include what your intuition tells you the person needs. Most people consult a Tarot reading for specific information. Those who understand the cards a little more may look on the reading as a means of finding a direction. And those who follow a series of readings will see them as a method of keeping in harmony with the changing patterns of life. But to spend a long time reading cards for yourself and others is to discover many things beyond personal information. We have already seen some of these things. One is people's pessimistic reactions to readings. Another, more important, is the way Tarot readings require - and therefore create - a balance between subjective and objective, intuitive and rational, immediate impression and established knowledge, right and left side of the brain. We cannot create such a balance simply by wanting it. We have to let it grow. Tarot readings can help this happen.",

        "text": "Finally, the Outcome. This card brings together all the others. More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question.

        "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

        "text": "Besides the new information gained, this method helps answer a question many people ask about Tarot readings: l If I did it again, different cards would appear, so how can these cards really mean anything? The answer is that the new cards will look at the same situation from a new point of view. Very often, if a reader sets out a Celtic Cross, then mixes the cards and does it over again, many of the same or similar cards will appear in the second reading. In one pair of readings I did for a married couple (with someone else's reading in between) six out of the ten cards were the same, and the Environment card in the woman’s reading was the one used as the Significator for the man. The Work Cycle, because it actually prevents the same cards from appearing, tends more to show different sides to the question. Sometimes the second line will almost mirror the first, indicating that the situation is heading so strongly in this direction that the person will not easily change it. At other times, however, the Outcome-Result will show a definite alternative to the first line, and then the reader must look to the starting points and to the Work cards. Once I did a reading for a woman with a jealous lover. Theoretically the two did not expect each other to be monogamous but the woman knew that if she went with someone else - and someone else had come along - her lover would be upset. She wanted advice on what to do and we did a Work Cycle (see Fig. 63).",

If the cards show something good, the subject still needs to know how to help this along. And if they show' disaster the reader must say so, but can also say what, if anything, the person can do. What brings about this unpleasant Outcome? Can these influences be altered or avoided? How can the person coun¬ teract, or at least cushion it? What elements show other possibilities? Can we look for anything good to come out of it? If the Outcome arises from some particular course of action, should the person abandon it? When we do a Tarot reading for someone we take on the responsibility of trying to send that person in a positive direction. Beyond specific suggestions of do this rather than that, lies a wider area of possible action derived from the ways the suits balance each other. In the introduction to each suit we con¬ sidered its problems and the way we could ‘add’ other suits/ elements. In practice, this adding is often difficult to achieve, because it means breaking the pattern shown in the reading itself. For this very reason, however, it is worth trying in situa¬ tions where the reading shows a dead end if the person stays with the elements given.",

For people with an awareness of the spiritual undercur¬ rents shaping all our lives the Tarot can show what particular shape these currents are taking at that moment. For others, readings may show the likely developments from some par¬ ticular situation or decision. Look for a new job, start a love affair, continue writing a novel - these are all mundane issues, seemingly far from the mystic concerns of the Major Arcana. Nevertheless, these are the things most people look at in Tarot readings; and in fact they are also the ways in which we truly develop, because they are the ways w'e involve ourselves in life. They form the reality rising out of the spiritual undercurrents. A Tarot reading can help us examine the consequences of such actions and decisions. Tarot readings, then, can give us information.

In these situations I read the Possible Outcome as something that might have happened but will not. The task then is to look at the other cards for the reason why the outcome should happen instead. Suppose the Star lies in the person’s Possible Outcome, indicating that the person might emerge feeling very free, full of hope, open to life. Suppose then that the Devil comes up as the actual Outcome, indicating bondage to an oppressive situation. What has gone wrong? If, say, the Nine of Swords reversed lies in the position of Basis, this would give us a clue, for it would say that the person holds inside her or him a sense of shame and humiliation coming from past weaknesses and fears, and that the ‘imprisonment’ symbolized in the Nine prevents the person from realizing the potential of the Star. These examples will help us to see that the true meaning of a Tarot reading does not come from specific cards but rather from the configurations they form together.",

The sadness came from realizing what she had lost, and also from the fact that she had grown up and cut her ties to her childhood.

Through the mandala, and through the introduction of new cards deliberately taken from the deck, we can extend or transform the situation. Here is an example of a mandala in which no extra cards were necessary. The reading itself provided all the images we needed. The following Work Cycle (Fig. 64) concerned a woman w'ho felt isolated from the people around her despite several apparently good friendships. The Cross illustrated the situation perfectly: Two of Pentacles crossed by Six of Swords. It showed her central situation of pretending to enjoy life and relations with others (Two of Pentacles) producing a sense of functioning (‘the swords do not weigh down the boat’) while she remained unable to connect with the people around her.

        "text": "(‘\"lake a careful approach, work at setting everything up before you do anything' or ‘Things won't work out with this person. You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

        "text": "Some books advise readers never to read for themselves because of the lack of objectivity. For a long time I went to a friend for readings and she to me, because neither of us trusted ourselves to interpret our own cards honestly. When I started doing my own readings I still found it hard to overcome various mental tricks to avoid unpleasant images. My favourite worked as follows: I could not ignore the cards I did not like or simply declare them untrue or exaggerated. That would have seemed too obvious. Therefore I looked in the reading for some very positive image, such as the Ace of Cups, and said to myself, ‘Well, that can't be true, nothing so good could come out of this mess.’ And then I would dismiss the whole reading on the grounds that if this one card made no sense none of the others did. Another trick I discovered myself doing was to lay out the cards very casually, so if something bad came up I could think, ‘Well, I didn't really mean it, I didn’t do it seriously.' I could only read for myself when I began treating the readings in the same way I would anyone else’s, mixing the cards carefully, working at the images, trying to get some direction for action (or inaction). A reading will not always give a clear yes or no answer to a question. It may show simply a complex of trends and influences. Sometimes the reading does not involve a choice because of an ongoing situation which cannot easily be avoided. Then specific images and meanings become very important. The Tarot can help us pinpoint the important elements in the situation, the ones that need the most work to change, or bring about, the predicted outcome. People",

        "text": "The fact is, the future does scare most people. They do not expect anything good to happen. They will settle for things staying the same - a balance of pain and happiness with a large measure of boredom, frustration, and low-level misery; but even such stability appears unlikely. In most people's eyes things can only get worse, and probably will. Tarot readings teach us many things beyond the particular information we get from them. One of these is the pre- dominance of pessimism. If a person’s cards all come out positive, glowing with promised happiness, the person will probably say, ‘Oh yes? I'll believe it when 1 see it.’ But if just one card hints at trouble or illness the response changes to ‘I knew it, I knew it. What am I going to do?’ With such an attitude, imagine how the fear, and perhaps resentment, rises when the dread information comes to them from a pack of cards. There is another side to this question of accepting the cards. People who go to Tarot readers often do so with a ‘show-me’ attitude. Since they look at divination as something ‘magical’ (though not really knowing what that means) they want the reader to demonstrate magical powers. The value of the reading for them lies in how accurately it matches what they know to be true about their lives, plus, of course, a bit of fresh information. To make sure the reader is ‘honest’, they conceal as much of their lives as possible. I remember one woman w ho came for advice about her work. Throughout the reading she stared blankly at me or the cards, giving me no indications at all if what I said meant anything to her. Afterwards, however, she went over every card, explaining how it related",
