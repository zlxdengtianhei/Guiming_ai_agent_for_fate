        "text": "Today, most people see the Tarot as a means of fortune-telling, or ‘divination’. Strangely, we know less historically about this aspect of the cards than any other. Judging by the comparatively few historical references to divination as opposed to gambling, the practice did not become common until some time after the introduction of the cards themselves. Possibly the Romany, or ‘gypsies’, came across the game of Tarocchi on their travels in Europe and decided to use the cards for fortune-telling. Or individuals developed the concept (the earliest written references are individual interpretations, though they might have derived from some earlier system, not written down but in general use) and the Romany took it from them. People used to believe that the Romany themselves brought the cards from Egypt. The fact is, the Romany probably came from India, and they arrived in Spain a good hundred years after Tarot cards were introduced in Italy and France. In the section on readings we will consider just what divination does, and how such an outrageous practice could possibly work. Here we can simply observe that people can and have told fortunes with anything - the smoky innards of slaughtered beasts, bird patterns across the sky, coloured stones, tossed coins, anything. The practice stems from the simple desire to know, in advance, what is going to happen, and more subtly, from the inner conviction that everything is connected, everything has meaning and that nothing occurs at random.",

The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

As the same cards come up in endless different combinations it becomes clear that people can always produce something new. At the same time, the newness will always come on top of underlying patterns. Through readings we learn in general the ways in which the past affects people, the ways in which their hopes and fears help create the future. But specific past situations and future expections - these will always surprise us. Here again we learn the habit of paying attention. For if we start interpreting the cards automatically on the basis of authoritative books or past readings then we lose the truth, and the readings become shallow and confused. Keep a book of past readings, yes, but not simply to use it as examples for future work. Instead, the book can help remind us of the variety and the constant newness of human behaviour. Notice that, as in creating balance, the Tarot does not simply help us to pay attention. It forces us to do so if we want our readings to produce good results. Tarot readings act as a kind of psychic exercise programme which strengthens the perceptive muscles. What people do with the information they get from Tarot readings teaches us some important lessons about free will. Many people look on the question of free will as an absolute. Either we make constant choices or we act according to destiny. To give it a more modern context, do we do what we do as a deliberate choice at that moment, or as a result of a In terms of Tarot this becomes a practical question.

        "text": "The very idea of randomness is really very modern. It developed out of the dogma that cause and effect is the only valid connection between two events. Events without this logical joining are random, that is, meaningless. Previously, however, people thought in terms of ‘correspondences’. Events or patterns in one area of existence corresponded to patterns in other areas. The pattern of the zodiac corresponds to the pattern of a person’s life. The pattern of tea leaves in the bottom of a cup corresponds to the outcome of a battle. Everything is connected. The idea has always claimed its adherents, and recently even some scientists, impressed by the way events will occur in series (like a ‘run of bad luck’), have begun to look seriously at it. If we can use anything for fortune-telling why use the Tarot? The answer is, that any system will tell us something ; the value of that something depends on the inherent wisdom of the system. Because the Tarot pictures carry deep significance all by themselves, the patterns they form in readings can teach us a great deal about ourselves, and life in general. Unfortunately, most diviners over the years have ignored these deeper meanings, preferring simple formulas (‘a dark man, one disposed to help the querent’), easily interpreted and quickly digested by the client. The formula meanings are often contradictory as well as blunt, with no indications of how to choose between them. This situation holds true especially for the Minor Arcana which is the bulk of the deck. Almost no works on the Tarot have treated this subject fully. Most serious studies, those which deal with the deep meanings of the Major Arcana, either do not mention the Minor cards at all, or simply throw in another set of formulas at the",

        "text": "Many people today still believe the Romany invented Tarot, despite clear evidence to the contrary. The connection between the two remains so strong that many women wishing to read professionally will dress in bright scarves and flounc¬ ing skirts and gold earrings (balloon pants and brocaded vests and one earring for men) and take names like ‘Madam Sosostris’ in order to satisfy the public. The long association of Tarot reading with cheap theatricals probably explains, at least in part, the contempt or lack of interest many Tarot students have shown towards divination. Seeing the Tarot as both a diagram and a tool of conscious evolution, occultists and esotericists will automatically dismiss the use of the cards to usher in ‘tall dark strangers’ or mysterious inheritances. And yet, by seeing only the abuse and not the deeper possibilities in readings, these occultists have themselves limited the Tarot's true value. Here is Arthur Edward Waite commenting on divination in his book The Pictorial Key to the Tarot: ‘The allocation of a fortune-telling aspect to these cards is the story of a prolonged impertinence.’ This brings us to an interesting paradox. Because they looked down on fortune-telling, Waite and others have extended the misuse of readings. The derogatory- way in which they wrote about it has fixed in many people’s minds the image of trivial attempts to predict the future. As to why they wrote of it at all, we can only guess that they or their publishers assumed the public demanded such an approach. After all, even today most people who pick up a book on Tarot care more about mysterious messages than they do about achieving psychic transformation. Certainly the best-selling Tarot books give the simplest formulas for the cards' meanings - and at the same time promise all knowledge.",

On one level we tell ourselves, 1 It’s only a pack of cards.’ But even those who do not dismiss the Tarot’s pre¬ dictions so easily may think, ‘Now that I know what it says I can make sure it won’t work out that way.’ Around the time I first began to use Tarot cards I consulted them on something I wanted to do but recognized was dangerous. The cards indicated disaster and spelled out quite clear the shape that disaster would take. I then said to myself, ‘Well, now that I’ve seen the dangers I can make sure I avoid them.’ I went ahead with what I wanted to do, and the situation worked out, in detail, the way the cards had predicted. Not having learned my lesson I read the cards again, hoping not for the truth, but for some reassuring message. I was using a book of meanings at that time, and when I looked up the Basis card the book gave as an interpretation, ‘Failure to follow' good advice’. The problem with making a decision based on a Tarot reading is that we never know how it would have turned out otherwise. Suppose a student considers leaving college and the cards advise strongly against it. If she follows the reading she will never know w'hat might have happened if she had followed her desire instead. Of course the whole point of the reading is that it does tell her what would have happened. But, she will always wonder, suppose it was not true? A prediction, especially from a pack of cards, can never carry the same impact as actual experience. Curiosity alone can make us do disastrous things.",

For people with an awareness of the spiritual undercur¬ rents shaping all our lives the Tarot can show what particular shape these currents are taking at that moment. For others, readings may show the likely developments from some par¬ ticular situation or decision. Look for a new job, start a love affair, continue writing a novel - these are all mundane issues, seemingly far from the mystic concerns of the Major Arcana. Nevertheless, these are the things most people look at in Tarot readings; and in fact they are also the ways in which we truly develop, because they are the ways w'e involve ourselves in life. They form the reality rising out of the spiritual undercurrents. A Tarot reading can help us examine the consequences of such actions and decisions. Tarot readings, then, can give us information.

        "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

This method is recommended when no definite question is asked-that is, when the Querent wishes to learn generally concerning the course of his life and destiny. If he wishes to know what may befall within a certain time, this time should be clearly specified before the cards are shuffled. With further reference to the reading, it should be remembered that the cards must be interpreted relatively to the subject, which means that all official and conventional meanings of the cards may and should be adapted to harmonize with the conditions of this particular case in question--the position, time of life and sex of the Querent, or person for whom the consultation is made. Thus, the Fool may indicate the whole range of mental phases between mere excitement and madness, but the particular phase in each divination must be judged by considering the general trend of the cards, and in this naturally the intuitive faculty plays an important part. It is well, at the beginning of a reading, to run through the cards quickly, so that the mind may receive a general impression of the subject-the trend of the destiny--and afterwards to start again--reading them one by one and interpreting in detail. It should be remembered that the Trumps represent more powerful and compelling forces--by the Tarot hypothesis--than are referable to the small cards.",

Place the cards needed for support at the bottom and the cards symbolizing goals at the top. Do not hesitate to introduce cards not found in the original reading if you find a strong need for qualities these cards represent. If you see a need for Temperance, for instance, place it below the centre; or if the reading shows a need for more developed will-power and discipline you might place the Chariot and the Nine of Pentacles side by side above the mandala, as the goal. In this way, you take charge of the reading, opening it to include what your intuition tells you the person needs. Most people consult a Tarot reading for specific information. Those who understand the cards a little more may look on the reading as a means of finding a direction. And those who follow a series of readings will see them as a method of keeping in harmony with the changing patterns of life. But to spend a long time reading cards for yourself and others is to discover many things beyond personal information. We have already seen some of these things. One is people's pessimistic reactions to readings. Another, more important, is the way Tarot readings require - and therefore create - a balance between subjective and objective, intuitive and rational, immediate impression and established knowledge, right and left side of the brain. We cannot create such a balance simply by wanting it. We have to let it grow. Tarot readings can help this happen.",

Where these are naturally present or have been developed by the Diviner, the fortuitous arrangement of cards forms a link between his mind and the atmosphere of the subject of divination, and then the rest is simple. Where intuition fails, or is absent, concentration, intellectual observation and deduction must be used to the fullest extent to obtain a satisfactory result. But intuition, even if apparently dormant, may be cultivated by practice in these divinatory processes. If in doubt as to the exact meaning of a card in a particular connexion, the Diviner is recommended, by those who are versed in the matter, to place his hand on it, try to refrain from thinking of what it ought to be, and note the impressions that arise in his mind. At the beginning this will probably resolve itself into mere guessing and may prove incorrect, but it becomes possible with practice to distinguish between a guess of the conscious mind and an impression arising from the mind which is sub-conscious. It is not within my province to offer either theoretical or practical suggestions on this subject, in which I have no part, but the following additamenta have been contributed by one who has more titles to speak than all the cartomancists of Europe, if they could shuffle with a single pair of hands and divine with one tongue. 1. Before beginning the operation, formulate your question definitely, and repeat it aloud. 2. Make your mind as blank as possible while shuffling the cards. 3. Put out of the mind personal bias and preconceived ideas as far as possible, or your judgment will be tinctured thereby. 4. On this account it is more easy to divine correctly for a stranger",

The question arises from a misunderstanding of free will itself; we think of it as something simple and independent of the past. At any moment, we think, we are free to do whatever we want. But our supposedly free choices are governed by our past actions. If we do not understand ourselves, how can we expect to make a free choice? Only by seeing and accepting the past can we free ourselves from it. A person may ask the cards about some situation. The cards very directly outline the consequences of some decision, say, whether or not to go ahead with a love affair, or to start some new project. Let us say that the cards indicate disaster, and that the person really can see the likelihood of what the cards predict. Now the person might say, ‘Well, this is likely, but my free will allows me to change the situation’. So he or she goes ahead and the situation turns out exactly as the cards predicted. The person has not really used free will at all; rather, the idea of free will has served as an excuse for ignoring what he or she recognized as a valid projection. This is not a hypothetical situation; it happens again and again with Tarot readings. It is not enough just to foresee a likely outcome for us to change or prevent that event. We must understand why it is coming, and we must work on the causes within ourselves for the things we do and the ways we react. Free will certainly exists. We just do not",

The use of divinatory methods, with whatsoever intention and for whatever purpose, carries with it two suggestions. It may be thought that the deeper meanings are imputed rather than real, but this is disposed of by the fact of certain cards, like the Magician, the High Priestess, the Wheel of Fortune, the Hanged Man, the Tower or Maison Dieu, and several others, which do not correspond to Conditions of Life, Arts, Sciences, Virtues, or the other subjects contained in the denaries of the Baldini emblematic figures. They are also proof positive that obvious and natural moralities cannot explain the sequence. Such cards testify concerning themselves after another manner; and although the state in which I have left the Tarot in respect of its historical side is so much the more difficult as it is so much the more open, they indicate the real subject matter with which we are concerned. The methods shew also that the Trumps Major at least have been adapted to fortune-telling rather than belong thereto. The common divinatory meanings which will be given in the third part are largely arbitrary attributions, or the product of secondary and uninstructed intuition; or, at the very most, they belong to the subject on a lower plane, apart from the original intention.

Sometimes, for an adult, the reading can reach back to childhood. The Tree of Life, too, though it usually shows an overview of the whole life, can sometimes show a shorter period if the person is going through a time of intense change. The different periods of time covered especially in the shorter readings, depend on two things. First, the person's situation and the question asked. Some things, practical or legal matters and certain emotional situations, can bring forth an answer that makes itself apparent within a few days. With others - the working out of emotional conflicts, deep relation¬ ships, spiritual or artistic development - it can take a long time before the reading fulfils itself. This does not mean that the readings will not ‘come true’ for years. We are not speaking of predictions, but of continuing patterns that slowly unfold as time passes. Second, the different levels a person may touch when mixing the cards. Sometimes he or she may evoke surface situations which last only a short time. At other times the person may mix the cards and somehow go to the very centre of experience. And even here, the reading may show the deep past, or it may reflect the person’s potential for future develop¬ ment. The level reached may not depend at all on the attitude of the person mixing the cards. Usually this approach does make a difference. Someone who sees a reading as a joke or a game will most likely produce a shallow reading; the person who thinks deeply of a question, mixes the cards carefully, and tries to sense",

        "text": "If any device will provide meaning, why Tarot? The answer is, any system will tell us something, but the quality of that something depends on the values contained in the system. The Tarot contains a philosophy, an outline of how human con¬ sciousness evolves, and a vast compendium of human experience. Shuffling the cards brings all these values into play with each other. We might argue that assigning a philosophy to the cards destroys their objectivity in terms of predicting events. Human values and interpretations have intruded in an otherwise.pure system. Such an idea, I think, would come from a misunder¬ standing of ‘objectivity’. The Tarot is objective because it bypasses conscious decision, but it is not impartial. On the contrary, it attempts to push us in certain directions: optimism, spirituality, a belief in the necessity and value of change. The meanings for the cards given in this book leave a good deal of room for interpretation by the reader. In fact, they require it. This is because the practised reader brings far more to her or his work than a detailed knowledge of the cards and their traditional meanings. Just as important is sensitivity - both to the pictures and to the person sitting there nervously and excitedly staring at the cards. A good reader does not simply repeat traditional fixed meanings. Rather, he or she will find new meanings and interpretations, will extend the patterns. While some people desire objective readings and dislike interpretation, others argue that a reader should not use any definite meanings at all, but always work from ‘feeling' the pictures at the moment. Yet to do so will limit the reader to the narrow range of his or her own perceptions. And those perceptions will always come at least partly from his or her",

        "text": "The fact is, the future does scare most people. They do not expect anything good to happen. They will settle for things staying the same - a balance of pain and happiness with a large measure of boredom, frustration, and low-level misery; but even such stability appears unlikely. In most people's eyes things can only get worse, and probably will. Tarot readings teach us many things beyond the particular information we get from them. One of these is the pre- dominance of pessimism. If a person’s cards all come out positive, glowing with promised happiness, the person will probably say, ‘Oh yes? I'll believe it when 1 see it.’ But if just one card hints at trouble or illness the response changes to ‘I knew it, I knew it. What am I going to do?’ With such an attitude, imagine how the fear, and perhaps resentment, rises when the dread information comes to them from a pack of cards. There is another side to this question of accepting the cards. People who go to Tarot readers often do so with a ‘show-me’ attitude. Since they look at divination as something ‘magical’ (though not really knowing what that means) they want the reader to demonstrate magical powers. The value of the reading for them lies in how accurately it matches what they know to be true about their lives, plus, of course, a bit of fresh information. To make sure the reader is ‘honest’, they conceal as much of their lives as possible. I remember one woman w ho came for advice about her work. Throughout the reading she stared blankly at me or the cards, giving me no indications at all if what I said meant anything to her. Afterwards, however, she went over every card, explaining how it related",

It is possible that their marriage was effected first in the Tarot of Bologna by that Prince of Pisa whom I have mentioned in the first part. It is said that his device obtained for him public recognition and reward from the city of his adoption, which would scarcely have been possible, even in those fantastic days, for the production of a Tarot which only omitted a few of the small cards; but as we are dealing with a question of fact which has to be accounted for somehow, it is conceivable that a sensation might have been created by a combination of the minor and gambling cards with the philosophical set, and by the adaptation of both to a game of chance. Afterwards it would have been further adapted to that other game of chance which is called fortune-telling. It should be understood here that I am not denying the possibility of divination, but I take exception as a mystic to the dedications which bring people into these paths, as if they had any relation to the Mystic Quest.",

        "text": "The Tarot teaches us as well the valuable lesson of context. No matter how absolute a quality may seem to us in the abstract, in reality it affects us only in the context of other influences. Readings demonstrate this fact in a practical way, as with the woman trying to deal with her lover’s jealousy. A card usually thought of as positive, the Sun, actually tended towards a bad result, for by hoping for the Sun she did not face the needs of the situation, and in fact allowed other people’s ideas to dictate what she wanted. Along with context we learn the ways in which the elements of life balance each other. We see first of all how the suits and specific cards combine to form a unified situation with no suit better or worse than any of the others. Astrologers often find that clients hope for certain signs and elements to dominate their charts, and will show disappointment or even shame if others appear. Similarly, for some people who know a little about Tarot, if a reading shows a lot of Wands, or Cups, they will feel comfor¬ ted; if it showed Swords they will become frightened; and if it shows Fentacles they will think of it as trivial, even insulting. Some will only accept a reading which contains many Major cards, because only the trumps, with their implications of power and spiritual awareness, appear important to them. But even the Major Arcana forms only one element, meaningless without the others. We study it in isolation for its wisdom and powerful description of existence. But in practice we need to mix the spiritual with the mundane, the happy with the sad, love and anger together to understand the world.",

        "text": "The cards teach yet another balance, one hinted at in the scales of justice. How does the past relate to the future possibilities? How do we combine the effects of our own decision with the influences of the outside world ? What do we mean when we say we take responsibility for our lives? Does it mean we create or control everything that happens to us? As in the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ sibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us entirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot readings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any moment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a very short person cannot expect to become a professional basketball player, so that same person must not consider his whole life dominated by height. People who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which counts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one really controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the meaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some readings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly dominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the determining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ ticular situation. Tarot readings help us develop confidence in our own perceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, and partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. Which of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case? Does a court card apply to the subject, some other person, or an abstract principle, such as the King of Swords signifying law and authority, or the Queen of Cups creativity? As we read more we find ourselves starting to sense the answers to these and",
