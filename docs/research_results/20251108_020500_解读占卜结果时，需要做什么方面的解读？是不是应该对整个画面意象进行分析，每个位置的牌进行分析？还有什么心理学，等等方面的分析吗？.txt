To construct such a pattern, choose the most important cards from the reading and work from the centre out, trying to build the image organically. Place the cards needed for support at the bottom and the cards symbolizing goals at the top. Do not hesitate to introduce cards not found in the original reading if you find a strong need for qualities these cards represent. If you see a need for Temperance, for instance, place it below the centre; or if the reading shows a need for more developed will-power and discipline you might place the Chariot and the Nine of Pentacles side by side above the mandala, as the goal. In this way, you take charge of the reading, opening it to include what your intuition tells you the person needs. Most people consult a Tarot reading for specific information. Those who understand the cards a little more may look on the reading as a means of finding a direction. And those who follow a series of readings will see them as a method of keeping in harmony with the changing patterns of life. But to spend a long time reading cards for yourself and others is to discover many things beyond personal information. We have already seen some of these things. One is people's pessimistic reactions to readings. Another, more important, is the way Tarot readings require - and therefore create - a balance between subjective and objective, intuitive and rational, immediate impression and established knowledge, right and left side of the brain. We cannot create such a balance simply by wanting it. We have to let it grow. Tarot readings can help this happen.

the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working.

Along with coherency comes the need for a positive approach. It is not enough to depict things as they are. The person wants to know what to do, what not to do. If the cards show something good, the subject still needs to know how to help this along. And if they show' disaster the reader must say so, but can also say what, if anything, the person can do. What brings about this unpleasant Outcome? Can these influences be altered or avoided? How can the person coun¬ teract, or at least cushion it? What elements show other possibilities? Can we look for anything good to come out of it? If the Outcome arises from some particular course of action, should the person abandon it? When we do a Tarot reading for someone we take on the responsibility of trying to send that person in a positive direction. Beyond specific suggestions of do this rather than that, lies a wider area of possible action derived from the ways the suits balance each other. In the introduction to each suit we con¬ sidered its problems and the way we could ‘add’ other suits/ elements. In practice, this adding is often difficult to achieve, because it means breaking the pattern shown in the reading itself. For this very reason, however, it is worth trying in situa¬ tions where the reading shows a dead end if the person stays with the elements given.

If any device will provide meaning, why Tarot? The answer is, any system will tell us something, but the quality of that something depends on the values contained in the system. The Tarot contains a philosophy, an outline of how human con¬ sciousness evolves, and a vast compendium of human experience. Shuffling the cards brings all these values into play with each other. We might argue that assigning a philosophy to the cards destroys their objectivity in terms of predicting events. Human values and interpretations have intruded in an otherwise.pure system. Such an idea, I think, would come from a misunder¬ standing of ‘objectivity’. The Tarot is objective because it bypasses conscious decision, but it is not impartial. On the contrary, it attempts to push us in certain directions: optimism, spirituality, a belief in the necessity and value of change. The meanings for the cards given in this book leave a good deal of room for interpretation by the reader. In fact, they require it. This is because the practised reader brings far more to her or his work than a detailed knowledge of the cards and their traditional meanings. Just as important is sensitivity - both to the pictures and to the person sitting there nervously and excitedly staring at the cards. A good reader does not simply repeat traditional fixed meanings. Rather, he or she will find new meanings and interpretations, will extend the patterns. While some people desire objective readings and dislike interpretation, others argue that a reader should not use any definite meanings at all, but always work from ‘feeling' the pictures at the moment. Yet to do so will limit the reader to the narrow range of his or her own perceptions. And those perceptions will always come at least partly from his or her

unreasonable hope. To recognize such things helps us gain a clearer perspective. Maybe our past experience governs our behaviour or confuses what we expect from the future. Knowing this consciously can put us on the way to overcom¬ ing it. Or maybe the cards will show us someone else’s jealousy or vindictiveness; we can then take steps to free our¬ selves from that person's influence. Or, if the cards show love and support from someone, w’e know' we can trust that person. All these things require some sort of response to make them real. We cannot expect to make use of a person’s friendship if we do not make ourselves open to it. Wherever possible the reader should try to point out to the subject definite steps w'hich can be taken to make best use of the information. If the reader cannot recommend a concrete course of action then he or she should point out what area the subject needs to work on. Above all, the reader must learn to form a coherent pattern from the reading. Often, beginning readers will learn the cards and advance to the point where they can skilfully interpret each image in its specific position. At the end the subject finds him or herself with a jumble of different points and no clear idea of how' it all fits together. A good reader can sum up what the reading says in a few sentences. Usually I will try to do this at both the beginning and end of the reading, impressing on the subject’s mind the most important points. Does the Environment support or hinder? Do the person’s Expectations help or hurt? Will the Outcome bring a valuable Result? The subject needs these questions answered, not just in all their complexity, but also in as

When the reading is over, according to the scheme set forth in the last method, it may happen-as in the previous case-that something remains doubtful, or it may be desired to carry the question further, which is done as follows:-- Take up the undealt cards which remain over, not having been used in the first operation with 42 cards. The latter are set aside in a heap, with the Querent, face upwards, on the top. The thirty-five cards, being shuffled and cut as before, are divided by dealing into six packets thus:-- Packet II consists of the SIX CARDS next following in order; Packet III consists of the FIVE CARDS following; Packet IV contains the next FOUR CARDS; Packet V contains Two CARDS; and Packet VI contains the last ELEVEN CARDS. The arrangement will then be as follows:-- Take up these packets successively; deal out the cards which they contain in six lines, which will be necessarily of unequal length. THE FIRST LINE stands for the house, the environment and so forth. THE SECOND LINE stands for the person or subject of the divination. THE THIRD LINE stands for what is passing outside, events, persons, etc. THE FOURTH LINE stands for a surprise, the unexpected, etc. THE FIFTH LINE stands for consolation, and may moderate all that is unfavourable in the preceding lines. THE SIXTH LINE is that which must be consulted to elucidate the enigmatic oracles of the others; apart from them it has no importance. These cards should all be read from left to right, beginning with the uppermost line. It should be stated in conclusion as to this divinatory part that there is no method of interpreting Tarot cards which is not applicable to ordinary playing-cards, but the additional court cards, and above all the Trumps Major,

takes experience and a strong feeling for the cards to help indicate the correct interpretation. Even very practised readers will often find the alternatives confusing. After the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the person is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her to empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on the Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question I ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out loud to fix it more firmly in the mind. The method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must be thorough and some of the cards must become turned around to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I sometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor (many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they use to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all around, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person to bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this method carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ sents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible combinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck bears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ tering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back together, it carries the new pattern. With the cards mixed the subject must separate them into three piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she must remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then from that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down on the left.

So far, we have considered ways to bring the influence of single cards into our lives. But a reading contains many cards which work together. To make a reading come alive, I have found it valuable to create what I call a ‘mandala' - a pattern formed from several cards. These cards can include not only those from the reading but others whose qualities will support the direction the reading advises. This act of deliberately adding cards not in the reading extends again the balance between the conscious and the unconscious. The reading has reached into the unconscious areas of knowledge to present a picture of the situation as it exists now. Through the mandala, and through the introduction of new cards deliberately taken from the deck, we can extend or transform the situation. Here is an example of a mandala in which no extra cards were necessary. The reading itself provided all the images we needed. The following Work Cycle (Fig. 64) concerned a woman w'ho felt isolated from the people around her despite several apparently good friendships. The Cross illustrated the situation perfectly: Two of Pentacles crossed by Six of Swords. It showed her central situation of pretending to enjoy life and relations with others (Two of Pentacles) producing a sense of functioning (‘the swords do not weigh down the boat’) while she remained unable to connect with the people around her. She remained like the woman in the boat, wrapped in her shroud, silent.

But the Rider pack does more than teach us this awareness. Certain cards, taken in the right way, can help produce it. Earlier, we considered the occult view that looking at geo¬ metric patterns will create effects in the brain. In a similar way joining ourselves meditatively to particular cards in the four suits will bring experiences reaching beyond the cards' specific meanings. I call these cards Gates, because of the way in which they open a path from the ordinary world to the inner level of archetypal experiences. Each suit contains at least one of these cards, the Pentacles containing the most. They all share cer¬ tain characteristics: complex, often contradictory, meanings, and a mythlike Strangeness which no allegorical interpreta¬ tion can completely penetrate. By choosing certain cards to fulfil this function I do not mean to imply that no others will do so, but only that in my experience these cards in particular do act in this way. Sometimes the Strangeness of a Gate will lie on the surface, but in other cards it only becomes apparent after we have analysed the card intellectually. The latter cases demonstrate a very important point - that outer and inner perceptions do not oppose each other, but rather bring each other out. The best approach to a Gate card begins with a knowledge of the card’s literal and symbolic meanings. When we have taken those as far as they will go we will arrive at the path of The Tarot demonstrates many things, some very unexpect¬ ed. These things emerge through interpretation of the Tarot's images, through joining ourselves to those images in medita¬ tion, and through seeing the combinations formed in readings. Taken separately, the cards of the Minor Arcana present us with a grand panorama of human experiences. Together,

The cards teach yet another balance, one hinted at in the scales of justice. How does the past relate to the future possibilities? How do we combine the effects of our own decision with the influences of the outside world ? What do we mean when we say we take responsibility for our lives? Does it mean we create or control everything that happens to us? As in the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ sibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us entirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot readings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any moment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a very short person cannot expect to become a professional basketball player, so that same person must not consider his whole life dominated by height. People who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which counts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one really controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the meaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some readings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly dominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the determining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ ticular situation. Tarot readings help us develop confidence in our own perceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, and partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. Which of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case? Does a court card apply to the subject, some other person, or an abstract principle, such as the King of Swords signifying law and authority, or the Queen of Cups creativity? As we read more we find ourselves starting to sense the answers to these and

explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'

We next placed cards in the four corners around the structure, beginning with the Six of Swords and the Eight of Wands in the bottom left and right. The cards showed the journey and its hoped for end. For the top corners we used the Eight of Swords reversed and the King of Wands reversed - the desired action and the attitude needed to produce it. Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.

For most of us, however, the repetitious patterns sharply limit the insights available from either studying the cards alone or using them in readings. Once we have memorized the formulas attached to each card we find it difficult to go further. In this book I have attempted to create what I call a ‘humanistic’ Tarot, derived not just from esoteric truths, but also from the insights of modern post-Jungian psychology to give a rounded picture of who we are, how we act, and what forces shape and direct us. In such a Tarot the goal is not fixed meanings, but rather a method by which each person can gain a greater insight into life. While the analysis of each card will come partly from its use in readings, with right side up and reversed meanings, the analysis will show primarily how that card adds to our knowledge of human experience. Because the Rider pack shows such vivid scenes the formulas or commentaries belonging to each card serve only as starting points. We can ponder the pictures themselves, and how they combine with the pictures around them. In a way the pictures and each person’s imagination (and experience) act as a partnership. In every reading, or in each meditation or reflection, we can look at each card as a fresh experience, just as the more esoteric decks work best for occult discipline, and the older decks for fortune-telling, so the Rider serves those of us who use the cards primarily for awareness of self and of the world around us.

In many cases, of course, the pictures are very simple and directly related to the meanings they were meant to illustrate. The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.

Finally, the Outcome. This card brings together all the others. More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question. Before leaving the Celtic Cross I would like to present a sample reading done by me some months before writing

First of all, the reader and the subject cannot use the reading at all until they understand it. Therefore the reader must develop skills of interpretation, and the best way to do this is to practise. When you begin do not assume a great depth of knowledge; just keep at it. Do not worry if you cannot see how things fit together, or become confused by all the possible interpretations of some single card. After a while you will find that you notice things that would have slid past you when you first began. Study. Learn the meanings described in whatever books strike you as valuable. Then begin the process of making your own book. Get a good notebook and record your descriptions, feelings, and experiences for each card. You can do this in words, pictures, diagrams, whatever method means some¬ thing to you. In the same or another book record the readings you do and what you have learned froirnhem. If some reading teaches you a new point about some sjtigle card or combina¬ tion or the whole deck, record this as well. Do not take for granted that you know what you have already learned. We all carry certain biases and as time goes by we tend to remember some meanings and forget others. Often a card will make no sense because we insist on interpreting it in a certain way strictly from habit, when another, forgotten meaning will clear it immediately. Therefore, from time to time, even after you think you know all the cards by heart, look back on your notes and your books. You will be surprised at how much you relearn.

The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we

Some who are gifted with reflective and discerning faculties in more than the ordinary sense--I am not speaking of clairvoyance may observe that in many of the Lesser Arcana there are vague intimations conveyed by the designs which seem to exceed the stated divinatory values. It is desirable to avoid misconception by specifying definitely that, except in rare instances--and then only by accident--the variations are not to be regarded as suggestions of higher and extradivinatory symbolism. I have said that these Lesser Arcana have not been translated into a language which transcends that of fortune telling. I should not indeed be disposed to regard them as belonging in their existing forms to another realm than this; but the field of divinatory possibilities is inexhaustible, by the hypothesis of the art, and the combined systems of cartomancy have indicated only the bare heads of significance attaching to the emblems in use. When the pictures in the present case go beyond the conventional meanings they should be taken as hints of possible developments along the same lines; and this is one of the reasons why the pictorial devices here attached to the four denaries will prove a great help to intuition. The mere numerical powers and bare words of the meanings are insufficient by themselves; but the pictures are like doors which open into unexpected chambers, or like a turn in the open road with a wide prospect beyond. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com will now be described according to their respective classes by the pictures to each belonging, and a harmony of their meanings will be provided from all sources.
