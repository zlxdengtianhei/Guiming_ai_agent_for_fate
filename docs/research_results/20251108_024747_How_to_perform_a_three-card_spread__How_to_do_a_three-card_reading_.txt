takes experience and a strong feeling for the cards to help indicate the correct interpretation. Even very practised readers will often find the alternatives confusing. After the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the person is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her to empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on the Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question I ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out loud to fix it more firmly in the mind. The method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must be thorough and some of the cards must become turned around to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I sometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor (many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they use to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all around, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person to bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this method carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ sents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible combinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck bears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ tering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back together, it carries the new pattern. With the cards mixed the subject must separate them into three piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she must remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then from that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down on the left.

The third innovation involves reading cards in combina¬ tions. In many readings (though certainly not all; see the Tree of Life method below) the cards are read individually, even though we attempt to combine the meanings, as in the Cross. In the Work Cycle, however, the positions include the idea of combinations. Readers who know Volume One of this book will remember that my interpretation of the Major Arcana divides the trumps into the Fool plus three lines of seven cards each, with each line showing a different stage of development. They may also remember that each line breaks down further into three parts. The first two cards signify the starting point for the line - the archetypes or basic qualities the person must use in going through the experiences shown in that line. The middle three stand for the basic work of the line - what the person must assimilate or overcome. The final two cards show the result. Thus, in the first line the Magician and the High Priestess indicate the basic archetypes of life. The Empress, the Emperor, and the I lierophant show the different aspects of the outer world facing us as we grow up. The Lovers and the Chariot symbolize the development of the successful individual. The Work Cycle borrows and adapts this tripartite structure. The reading begins w'ith choosing the Significator and mixing the cards in the same manner as with the Celtic Cross. Similarly, the first two cards from a small cross, interpreted much the same way as in the older method of reading, with perhaps more emphasis on the crossing card being an outcome or development of the Centre card. After the small cross the reader turns over seven cards in a row below the Significator rather than around it, with the

Now the reader takes over, and here again people disagree about how to put the deck back together. Some simply pick up the pile on the right with the left hand, place it over the middle pile and then put these two piles over the pile on the left. Others hold their left hand a few inches over each pile until a warmth seems to rise from one of them. They then place this pile over the other two. Either way, when the deck has re-formed, the reader, using the right hand, begins to turn over the cards in whatever pattern he or she has decided to follow. Hundreds of patterns exist. Of the three presented here, one I made up, while the other two are variations on traditional themes. Almost any book on Tarot will give further patterns. Over the years this pattern has proved the most popular. The Cross derives its name from its shape, a cross of equal arms (one card on each side of the centre), with four cards lined up as a ‘Staff’ beside it (see Fig. 59, p.147). As we might expect, commentators disagree on the meaning of particular positions and how to describe them. Some, such as Waite and Eden Gray, provide a sort of ritual for the reader to pronounce while laying out the cards: ‘This covers him’ or ‘This lies beneath him’. Others prefer more conventional phraseology. It does not matter which system we use as long as we remain constant. The meanings described below are the ones I use. I'hey follow the traditional system, with certain changes. In every way of laying out the Celtic Cross the first two cards form a small cross of their own with the first one, the ‘cover' card, lying directly on top of the

When the reading is over, according to the scheme set forth in the last method, it may happen-as in the previous case-that something remains doubtful, or it may be desired to carry the question further, which is done as follows:-- Take up the undealt cards which remain over, not having been used in the first operation with 42 cards. The latter are set aside in a heap, with the Querent, face upwards, on the top. The thirty-five cards, being shuffled and cut as before, are divided by dealing into six packets thus:-- Packet II consists of the SIX CARDS next following in order; Packet III consists of the FIVE CARDS following; Packet IV contains the next FOUR CARDS; Packet V contains Two CARDS; and Packet VI contains the last ELEVEN CARDS. The arrangement will then be as follows:-- Take up these packets successively; deal out the cards which they contain in six lines, which will be necessarily of unequal length. THE FIRST LINE stands for the house, the environment and so forth. THE SECOND LINE stands for the person or subject of the divination. THE THIRD LINE stands for what is passing outside, events, persons, etc. THE FOURTH LINE stands for a surprise, the unexpected, etc. THE FIFTH LINE stands for consolation, and may moderate all that is unfavourable in the preceding lines. THE SIXTH LINE is that which must be consulted to elucidate the enigmatic oracles of the others; apart from them it has no importance. These cards should all be read from left to right, beginning with the uppermost line. It should be stated in conclusion as to this divinatory part that there is no method of interpreting Tarot cards which is not applicable to ordinary playing-cards, but the additional court cards, and above all the Trumps Major,

To construct such a pattern, choose the most important cards from the reading and work from the centre out, trying to build the image organically. Place the cards needed for support at the bottom and the cards symbolizing goals at the top. Do not hesitate to introduce cards not found in the original reading if you find a strong need for qualities these cards represent. If you see a need for Temperance, for instance, place it below the centre; or if the reading shows a need for more developed will-power and discipline you might place the Chariot and the Nine of Pentacles side by side above the mandala, as the goal. In this way, you take charge of the reading, opening it to include what your intuition tells you the person needs. Most people consult a Tarot reading for specific information. Those who understand the cards a little more may look on the reading as a means of finding a direction. And those who follow a series of readings will see them as a method of keeping in harmony with the changing patterns of life. But to spend a long time reading cards for yourself and others is to discover many things beyond personal information. We have already seen some of these things. One is people's pessimistic reactions to readings. Another, more important, is the way Tarot readings require - and therefore create - a balance between subjective and objective, intuitive and rational, immediate impression and established knowledge, right and left side of the brain. We cannot create such a balance simply by wanting it. We have to let it grow. Tarot readings can help this happen.

Finally, the Outcome. This card brings together all the others. More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question. Before leaving the Celtic Cross I would like to present a sample reading done by me some months before writing

(‘"lake a careful approach, work at setting everything up before you do anything' or ‘Things won't work out with this person. You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.

The cards are then read in succession, from right to left throughout, beginning at card No. 1 of the top line, the last to be read being that on the extreme left, or No. 7, of the bottom line. This method is recommended when no definite question is asked-that is, when the Querent wishes to learn generally concerning the course of his life and destiny. If he wishes to know what may befall within a certain time, this time should be clearly specified before the cards are shuffled. With further reference to the reading, it should be remembered that the cards must be interpreted relatively to the subject, which means that all official and conventional meanings of the cards may and should be adapted to harmonize with the conditions of this particular case in question--the position, time of life and sex of the Querent, or person for whom the consultation is made. Thus, the Fool may indicate the whole range of mental phases between mere excitement and madness, but the particular phase in each divination must be judged by considering the general trend of the cards, and in this naturally the intuitive faculty plays an important part. It is well, at the beginning of a reading, to run through the cards quickly, so that the mind may receive a general impression of the subject-the trend of the destiny--and afterwards to start again--reading them one by one and interpreting in detail. It should be remembered that the Trumps represent more powerful and compelling forces--by the Tarot hypothesis--than are referable to the small cards.

Some books advise readers never to read for themselves because of the lack of objectivity. For a long time I went to a friend for readings and she to me, because neither of us trusted ourselves to interpret our own cards honestly. When I started doing my own readings I still found it hard to overcome various mental tricks to avoid unpleasant images. My favourite worked as follows: I could not ignore the cards I did not like or simply declare them untrue or exaggerated. That would have seemed too obvious. Therefore I looked in the reading for some very positive image, such as the Ace of Cups, and said to myself, ‘Well, that can't be true, nothing so good could come out of this mess.’ And then I would dismiss the whole reading on the grounds that if this one card made no sense none of the others did. Another trick I discovered myself doing was to lay out the cards very casually, so if something bad came up I could think, ‘Well, I didn't really mean it, I didn’t do it seriously.' I could only read for myself when I began treating the readings in the same way I would anyone else’s, mixing the cards carefully, working at the images, trying to get some direction for action (or inaction). A reading will not always give a clear yes or no answer to a question. It may show simply a complex of trends and influences. Sometimes the reading does not involve a choice because of an ongoing situation which cannot easily be avoided. Then specific images and meanings become very important. The Tarot can help us pinpoint the important elements in the situation, the ones that need the most work to change, or bring about, the predicted outcome. People

Besides the new information gained, this method helps answer a question many people ask about Tarot readings: l If I did it again, different cards would appear, so how can these cards really mean anything? The answer is that the new cards will look at the same situation from a new point of view. Very often, if a reader sets out a Celtic Cross, then mixes the cards and does it over again, many of the same or similar cards will appear in the second reading. In one pair of readings I did for a married couple (with someone else's reading in between) six out of the ten cards were the same, and the Environment card in the woman’s reading was the one used as the Significator for the man. The Work Cycle, because it actually prevents the same cards from appearing, tends more to show different sides to the question. Sometimes the second line will almost mirror the first, indicating that the situation is heading so strongly in this direction that the person will not easily change it. At other times, however, the Outcome-Result will show a definite alternative to the first line, and then the reader must look to the starting points and to the Work cards. Once I did a reading for a woman with a jealous lover. Theoretically the two did not expect each other to be monogamous but the woman knew that if she went with someone else - and someone else had come along - her lover would be upset. She wanted advice on what to do and we did a Work Cycle (see Fig. 63).

So far, we have considered ways to bring the influence of single cards into our lives. But a reading contains many cards which work together. To make a reading come alive, I have found it valuable to create what I call a ‘mandala' - a pattern formed from several cards. These cards can include not only those from the reading but others whose qualities will support the direction the reading advises. This act of deliberately adding cards not in the reading extends again the balance between the conscious and the unconscious. The reading has reached into the unconscious areas of knowledge to present a picture of the situation as it exists now. Through the mandala, and through the introduction of new cards deliberately taken from the deck, we can extend or transform the situation. Here is an example of a mandala in which no extra cards were necessary. The reading itself provided all the images we needed. The following Work Cycle (Fig. 64) concerned a woman w'ho felt isolated from the people around her despite several apparently good friendships. The Cross illustrated the situation perfectly: Two of Pentacles crossed by Six of Swords. It showed her central situation of pretending to enjoy life and relations with others (Two of Pentacles) producing a sense of functioning (‘the swords do not weigh down the boat’) while she remained unable to connect with the people around her. She remained like the woman in the boat, wrapped in her shroud, silent.

Turn up the SECOND CARD and lay it across the FIRST, saying: This crosses him. It shews the nature of the obstacles in the matter. If it is a favourable card, the opposing forces will not be serious, or it may indicate that something good in itself will not be productive of good in the particular connexion. Turn up the THIRD CARD; place it above the Significator, and say: This crowns him. It represents (a) the Querent's aim or ideal in the matter; (b) the best that can be achieved under the circumstances, but that which has not yet been made actual. Turn up the FOURTH CARD; place it below the Significator, and say: This is beneath him. It shews the foundation or basis of the matter, that which has already passed into actuality and which the Significator has made his own. Turn up the FIFTH CARD; place it on the side of the Significator from which he is looking, and say: This is behind him. It gives the influence that is just passed, or is now passing away. N.B.--If the Significator is a Trump or any small card that cannot be said to face either way, the Diviner must decide before beginning the operation which side he will take it as facing. Turn up the SIXTH CARD; place it on the side that the Significator is facing, and say: This is before him. It shews the influence that is coming into action and will operate in the near future. The cards are now disposed in the form of a cross, the Significator--covered by the First Card--being in the centre. The next four cards are turned up in succession and placed one above the other in a line, on the right hand side of the cross. The first of these,

First of all, the reader and the subject cannot use the reading at all until they understand it. Therefore the reader must develop skills of interpretation, and the best way to do this is to practise. When you begin do not assume a great depth of knowledge; just keep at it. Do not worry if you cannot see how things fit together, or become confused by all the possible interpretations of some single card. After a while you will find that you notice things that would have slid past you when you first began. Study. Learn the meanings described in whatever books strike you as valuable. Then begin the process of making your own book. Get a good notebook and record your descriptions, feelings, and experiences for each card. You can do this in words, pictures, diagrams, whatever method means some¬ thing to you. In the same or another book record the readings you do and what you have learned froirnhem. If some reading teaches you a new point about some sjtigle card or combina¬ tion or the whole deck, record this as well. Do not take for granted that you know what you have already learned. We all carry certain biases and as time goes by we tend to remember some meanings and forget others. Often a card will make no sense because we insist on interpreting it in a certain way strictly from habit, when another, forgotten meaning will clear it immediately. Therefore, from time to time, even after you think you know all the cards by heart, look back on your notes and your books. You will be surprised at how much you relearn.

person mixing the cards. Usually this approach does make a difference. Someone who sees a reading as a joke or a game will most likely produce a shallow reading; the person who thinks deeply of a question, mixes the cards carefully, and tries to sense the exact moment to stop and cut the deck, will usually produce a reading of some significance.

explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'

I here append a diagram of the cards as laid out in this mode of divination. The Significator is here facing to the left. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com Shuffle the entire pack and turn some of the cards round, so as to invert their tops. Let them be cut by the Querent with his left hand. Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner. In this method, the Querent--if of the male sex--is represented by the Magician, and if female by the High Priestess; but the card, in either case, is not taken from the pack until the forty-two cards have been laid out, as above directed. If the required card is not found among those placed upon the table, it must be sought among the remaining thirty-six cards, which

We come now to the final and practical part of this division of our subject, being the way to consult and obtain oracles by means of Tarot cards. The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled "The Divining Tarot"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman

The most direct way to bring in an outside influence involves simple suggestions. If the reading indicates a need for the grounding influence of Pentacles, the subject can try doing more physical things, such as sports or gardening, or paying more attention to more mundane activities, such as work or study or keeping busy around the house. If the reading shows a need for the watery qualities of Cups, then the reader may emphasize the person’s dreams and fantasies, and may suggest activities such as meditation or drawing. A person can fill a need for Wands by becoming more active physically, competing with other people, or starting new projects. And a need for Swords would call for a sober, carefully thought out approach to the person’s situation. The important thing about these recommendations is that they reach beyond the reading. They deal with the cards that do not appear as well as the ones that do. Therefore, beginning readers should use this method carefully, lest they assume too much knowledge and control on their part. So far, we have considered practical responses to the informa¬ tion gained from a reading. But a Tarot reading is not the words describing it; it is rather a series of pictures. And the most direct response to a reading depends on working with the pictures themselves. For people who know the cards well, or for people with some experience in meditation, it becomes possible to work directly with the images to help bring about the effects associated with that card. There is nothing vague or mysterious about this process. It requires concentration as well as instinctive feeling, and it does not replace practical steps. On the contrary, it helps to make those steps more accessible. For if the card Strength appears in a reading

This line forms the basic cycle, and the reading may stop with these nine cards. However, if after interpreting this line, the reader and subject desire more information or simply another approach, the reader turns over a second line of seven directly below the first, and so on, until the meaning becomes clear. In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.
