For years Tarocchi was seen primarily as a game for gambling, and to a much lesser extent as a device for fortune-telling. Then, in the eighteenth century, an occultist named Antoine Court de Gebelin declared the Tarot (as the French called the game) to be the remnant of the Book of Thoth, created by the Egyptian god of magic to convey all knowledge to his disciples. Court de Gebelin s idea appears far more fanciful than factual, but in the nineteenth century another Frenchman, Alphonse Louis Constant, known as Eliphas Levi, linked the cards to the Qabalah, and since then people have looked deeper and deeper into the Tarot, finding more and more meanings, wisdom, and even, through meditation and deep study, enlightenment. Today, we see the Tarot as a kind of path, a way to personal growth through understanding of ourselves and life. To some the Tarot's origin remains a vital question, for others it only matters that meanings have accrued to the cards over the soars. For Bembo did create an archetype, whether consciously or from deep instinct. Beyond any system or detailed explanations, the images themselves, changed and elaborated over the years by different artists, fascinate and entrance us. In this way they draw us into their mysterious world which ultimately can never be explained, but only experienced. Most modern Tarots differ very little from those fifteenth century sets of cards. They still contain seventy-eight cards divided into the four suits, Wands, Cups, Swords, and Coins or Pentacles, called collectively the ‘Minor Arcana’, and the twenty-two trumps, known as the ‘Major Arcana’ (the word ‘arcanum’ means ‘secret knowledge’). True, some of the pictures have changed considerably, but each version usually keeps the same basic concept. For example, there are several widely varying versions of the Emperor, but

In his apologia for his deck Waite took great pains to defend certain changes he made in the design and number of the cards in the Major Arcana. However, most newcomers to Tarot* comparing the Rider pack (centre, above) to say, the more traditional Marseilles deck (left, above) will have to look quite closely before they observe most of these changes. They will immediately see the difference in the Minor cards. In every deck designed before the Rider pack the 'pip cards, numbers 1-10 of the four suits, bear geometric patterns con¬ taining the number of swords, or w'ands, or cups, or coins. In this they resemble their descendants, ordinary playing cards. In most decks these patterns are plain and repetitious. The elaborate Crow'ley deck (right, above) stands out as the excep¬ tion. The Waite-Smith deck, however, has an illustration on every card. Primarily concerned with the more esoteric Major cards, Waite apparently did not realize how this rich variety of scenes would captivate the average viewer seeking to experi¬ ment with Tarot. In a way, their very newness adds to their charm. Where the Major Arcana strikes us with the ancien¬ tness as well as the complexity of its symbolism, the Minor cards, having no pictorial tradition, appear to us as scenes taken directly from life, or in some cases, fantasy. The fact that Smith drew' these scenes in a pseudo- mediaeval style seems not to bother most people. They find the liveliness more important. Almost all the Major cards show a figure sitting or standing; only the Fool and the World move. In fact, they dance. But in the Minor cards, all the scenes show something happening , rather like a frame from a movie.

so much material to his purpose. Think only for a moment about the card of the High Priestess as representing the Albigensian church itself; and think of the Tower struck by Lightning as typifying the desired destruction of Papal Rome, the city on the seven hills, with the pontiff and his temporal power cast down from the spiritual edifice when it is riven by the wrath of God. The possibilities are so numerous and persuasive that they almost deceive in their expression one of the elect who has invented them. But there is more even than this, though I scarcely dare to cite it. When the time came for the Tarot cards to be the subject of their first formal explanation, the archaeologist Court de Gebelin reproduced some of their most important emblems, and--if I may so term it--the codex which he used has served--by means of his engraved plates-as a basis of reference for many sets that have been issued subsequently. The figures are very primitive and differ as such from the cards of Etteilla, the Marseilles Tarot, and others still current in France. I am not a good judge in such matters, but the fact that every one of the Trumps Major might have answered for watermark purposes is shewn by the cases which I have quoted and by one most remarkable example of the Ace of Cups.

ed. These things emerge through interpretation of the Tarot's images, through joining ourselves to those images in medita¬ tion, and through seeing the combinations formed in readings. Taken separately, the cards of the Minor Arcana present us with a grand panorama of human experiences. Together, and in union with the archetypal Major cards, they draw us into ever wider knowledge of the changing wonder of life.

acting out some situation with the figures in the picture. This may happen overwhelmingly, so that you find your whole being there instead of here. More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it. Keep your eyes closed or opened, depending on what works for you; most people find that at least when the fantasy starts they prefer their eyes closed. Try to

The contrast is no accident. The Major cards depict archetypal forces rather than real people. The Fool and the World Dancer move, because only they fully embody these principles. But the Minor cards show aspects of life as people actually live it. In these four suits, and more especially in the combinations they form when we lay them out in readings, we find a panorama of experience, constantly showing us new insights into the wonders of human nature and this magical world. Precisely because it shows ordinary life rather than a formal system the Rider pack does not appeal to many occultists. While a great many subsequent decks have copied, with small or large variations, the Rider pack, other decks, including ones we might characterize as 'most serious', such as the Crowley or the Builders of the Adytum deck, have returned to the use of patterns for the pip cards. They do so because their creators concerned themselves with the Tarot as a system of organizing and structuring esoteric practices, both as a tool and as a living force. '1 he Tarot, for them, forms a vital link to mystical systems.

The most important of these links is that connecting the four suits to the four worlds described in the Qabalah. Qabalists view the universe as existing in four stages, the closest to us (and the furthest from direct union with God) being the ordinary material world, called Assiyah, the 'World of Action'. For greater understanding the mediaeval theoso- phists described each world as embodied in a Free of Life, a diagram of cosmic law. Now, the structure of the Tree does not change in the different worlds. Each tree contains ten Sephiroth, or archetypes of emanation. (For the Tree’s most common pattern, see the Pen of Pentacles.) And here, of course, the Tarot comes in. Because the four suits each contain ten pip cards, we can place the cards on the Sephiroth to give us a concrete aid in meditation. And because the Sephiroth represent archetypal forces, most occultists prefer abstract designs to emblemize them. For them, a scene of people doing something, such as three women dancing, or a group of boys fighting, only distracts from the eternal sym¬ bolism. Some occultists go further, believing that the geometric patterns on the cards carry a psychic power all their own, and that by looking deeply at these patterns in their special colours, we can produce certain distinct effects within the brain. Many people who are not especially esotericists will still prefer the older decks to any of the modern interpretations, including the geometric ones. For them, the sense of a tradi¬ tion, of meanings developed over centuries, carries a power no revised edition can equal. In readings they look to the ancient formulas and find the Rider pack’s detailed scenes a distrac¬ tion. Often the more psychic readers will use the older cards, finding that the very abstractness of the

The resources of interpretation have been lavished, if not exhausted, on the twenty-two Trumps Major, the symbolism of which is unquestionable. There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.

The figure calls for no special description the face is rather dark, suggesting also courage, but somewhat lethargic in tendency. The bull's head should be noted as a recurrent symbol on the throne. The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.

Since the Rider pack quite a few Tarot designers have attempted to include a scene on every card. Just about all have paid tribute to Pamela Smith's images, some extremely closely, while others have imaginatively transformed the Rider pictures. Nothing compels them to use these images; they carry no authority of ancient tradition, as do the Major cards. Their authority derives from creative achievement. These crudely drawn pictures, awkward, often out of all proportion or perspective, based on sentimental ideas of the Middle Ages, somehow have led thousands of people into an understanding not just of the cards but of themselves. In one stroke Pamela Smith created a new tradition. However much the depiction of the individual cards broke with previous practice, Waite stayed close to earlier decks in his arrangement of the suits and their emblems - with one exception. Where older decks, going all the way back to the fifteenth-century Visconti-Sforza deck, used Wands (or Staves), Cups, Swords, and Coins (or discs), the Rider pack substituted Pentacles - five pointed stars enclosed in gold discs - for the final suit. Waite made this change for two reasons. First, he wanted his fourth suit to represent the full range of the physical world, not simply the narrow materialism of money and business. Second, he wanted the four suits to carry the four basic tools of ritual magic. In reality the two reasons are one. Waite knew that magicians used these objects partly because they symbolized in concrete form the various aspects of the physical/spiritual universe. The association of these four emblems with both magical practice and the spiritual truth underlying life goes back at least as far the the Middle Ages, where we find their equiva¬ lents in the symbolic objects carried by the Grail maidens. Waite himself knew

Above I wrote that I chose the Rider pack as my ‘primary’ source. Most books on the Tarot use one deck alone for illustrations. This self-limitation perhaps stems from a desire to represent the ‘true’ Tarot. By choosing one deck and not another we are really declaring that one is correct and the other is false. Such a declaration matters most to those writers, like Aleister Crowley or Paul Foster Case, who consider the Tarot a symbolic system of objective knowledge. This book, however, looks upon the cards more as an archetype of experience. Seen that way no deck is right or wrong, but is simply a furthering of the archetype. The Tarot is both the total of all the different versions over the years, and an entity apart from any of them. In the cases where a version other than Waite’s will deepen the meaning of a specific card we will look at both images. In some cases, Judgement for instance, or the Moon, the differences are subtle; in others, the Lovers, or the Fool, the difference is drastic. By looking at several versions of the same experience we heighten our awareness of that experience.

I here append a diagram of the cards as laid out in this mode of divination. The Significator is here facing to the left. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com Shuffle the entire pack and turn some of the cards round, so as to invert their tops. Let them be cut by the Querent with his left hand. Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner. In this method, the Querent--if of the male sex--is represented by the Magician, and if female by the High Priestess; but the card, in either case, is not taken from the pack until the forty-two cards have been laid out, as above directed. If the required card is not found among those placed upon the table, it must be sought among the remaining thirty-six cards, which

know who actually designed these cards. Did Waite himself conceive them (as he undoubtedly did the Major Arcana), or did he simply tell Smith the qualities and ideas he wanted and allow her to invent the scenes? Waite’s own book on the Tarot, The Pictorial Key to the Tarot , makes little real use of the pictures. In some cases, such as the six of Swords, the picture suggests far more than Waite’s stated meaning, while in others, particularly the two of Swords, the picture almost contradicts the meaning.

more involved with the pictures, developing our intuition, then sometimes we can get experiences of Certitude, of knowing the true meaning of something. While such experiences carry their own value, they serve us most by giving us a sense of direction. They help us perceive what we want to achieve. Finally, the practice of Tarot reading teaches us something else. Because the cards arc not neutral in their attitude to life, because they embody certain approaches and beliefs, and renounce others, they change us. We begin over time - always over time - to see the balance of things, the steady harmony within the constant shift and flow of life. We become aware of the Strangeness always waiting beyond our ordinary experience, we learn to recognize the gifts we receive from existence, and our own responsibility to understand and use them. Most of all, we begin to grasp the truth the Tarot always urges upon us - that the universe the whole universe, lives. And what we can know of ourselves we can know of everything.

I have said that this symbol is essentially invariable in all Tarot sets, or at least the variations do not alter its character. The great angel is here encompassed by clouds, but he blows his bannered trumpet, and the cross as usual is displayed on the banner. The dead are rising from their tombs--a woman on the right, a man on the left hand, and between them their child, whose back is turned. But in this card there are more than three who are restored, and it has been thought worth while to make this variation as illustrating the insufficiency of current explanations. It should be noted that all the figures are as one in the wonder, adoration and ecstacy expressed by their attitudes. It is the card which registers the accomplishment of the great work of transformation in answer to the summons of the Supernal--which summons is heard and answered from within. Herein is the intimation of a significance which cannot well be carried further in the present place. What is that within us which does sound a trumpet and all that is lower in our nature rises in response--almost in a moment, almost in the twinkling of an eye? Let the card continue to depict, for those who can see no further, the Last judgment and the resurrection in the natural body; but let those who have inward eyes look and discover therewith. They will understand that it has been called truly in the past a card of eternal life, and for this reason it may be compared with that which passes under the name of Temperance.

We next placed cards in the four corners around the structure, beginning with the Six of Swords and the Eight of Wands in the bottom left and right. The cards showed the journey and its hoped for end. For the top corners we used the Eight of Swords reversed and the King of Wands reversed - the desired action and the attitude needed to produce it. Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.

This book uses as its primary source, the Tarot of Arthur Edward Waite, whose very popular Rider pack (named after its British publisher) appeared in 1910. Waite was criticized for changing some of the trump cards from their accepted version. For instance, the common picture of the Sun shows two children holding hands in a garden. Waite changed it to one child on a horse riding out of a garden. The critics claimed Waite was altering the card’s meaning to his personal vision. This was probably the case, since Waite believed more strongly in his own ideas than those of anyone else. But few people stopped to consider that the earliest version of the Sun, that of Bembo, in no way resembles the supposed ‘traditional' version. Indeed, it seems closer to Waite's; the picture shows a single miraculous child flying through the air, holding up a globe with an image of a city inside it. The most striking change Waite and his artist, Pamela Colman Smith, made was to include a scene on all the cards, including the numbered cards of the Minor Arcana. Virtually all previous decks, as well as many later ones, have simple geometric patterns for the ‘pip’ cards. For example, the ten of Swords will show ten swords arranged in a pattern, much like its descendant, the ten of spades. The Rider pack is different. Pamela Smith’s ten of Swords shows a man lying under a black cloud with ten swords stuck in his back and legs. We do not really know who actually designed these cards. Did Waite himself conceive them (as he undoubtedly did the Major Arcana), or did he simply tell Smith the qualities and ideas he wanted and allow her to invent the scenes?

Some who are gifted with reflective and discerning faculties in more than the ordinary sense--I am not speaking of clairvoyance may observe that in many of the Lesser Arcana there are vague intimations conveyed by the designs which seem to exceed the stated divinatory values. It is desirable to avoid misconception by specifying definitely that, except in rare instances--and then only by accident--the variations are not to be regarded as suggestions of higher and extradivinatory symbolism. I have said that these Lesser Arcana have not been translated into a language which transcends that of fortune telling. I should not indeed be disposed to regard them as belonging in their existing forms to another realm than this; but the field of divinatory possibilities is inexhaustible, by the hypothesis of the art, and the combined systems of cartomancy have indicated only the bare heads of significance attaching to the emblems in use. When the pictures in the present case go beyond the conventional meanings they should be taken as hints of possible developments along the same lines; and this is one of the reasons why the pictorial devices here attached to the four denaries will prove a great help to intuition. The mere numerical powers and bare words of the meanings are insufficient by themselves; but the pictures are like doors which open into unexpected chambers, or like a turn in the open road with a wide prospect beyond. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com will now be described according to their respective classes by the pictures to each belonging, and a harmony of their meanings will be provided from all sources.

The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com He holds a short sceptre in his left hand and a great cup in his right; his throne is set upon the sea; on one side a ship is riding and on the other a dolphin is leaping. The implicit is that the Sign of the Cup naturally refers to water, which appears in all the court cards. Divinatory Meanings: Fair man, man of business, law, or divinity; responsible, disposed to oblige the Querent; also equity, art and science, including those who profess science, law and art; creative intelligence. Reversed: Dishonest, double-dealing man; roguery, exaction, injustice, vice, scandal, pillage, considerable loss. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com Beautiful, fair, dreamy--as one who sees visions in a cup. This is, however, only one of her aspects; she sees, but she also acts, and her activity feeds her dream. Divinatory Meanings: Good, fair woman; honest, devoted woman, who will do service to the Querent; loving intelligence, and hence the gift of vision; success, happiness, pleasure; also wisdom, virtue; a perfect spouse and a good mother. Reversed: The accounts vary; good woman; otherwise, distinguished woman but one not to be trusted; perverse woman; vice, dishonour, depravity. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com Graceful, but not warlike; riding quietly, wearing a winged helmet, referring to those higher graces of the imagination which sometimes characterize this card. He too is a dreamer, but the images of the side of sense haunt him in his vision. Divinatory Meanings: Arrival, approach--sometimes that of a messenger; advances, proposition, demeanour, invitation, incitement. Reversed: Trickery, artifice, subtlety, swindling, duplicity, fraud.

So also are the conventional meanings, which refer to changes in the seasons, perpetual movement of life and even the combination of ideas. It is, moreover, untrue to say that the figure symbolizes the genius of the sun, though it is the analogy of solar light, realized in the third part of our human triplicity. It is called Temperance fantastically, because, when the rule of it obtains in our consciousness, it tempers, combines and harmonises the psychic and material natures. Under that rule we know in our rational part something of whence we came and whither we are going. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com The design is an accommodation, mean or harmony, between several motives mentioned in the first part. The Horned Goat of Mendes, with wings like those of a bat, is standing on an altar. At the pit of the stomach there is the sign of Mercury. The right hand is upraised and extended, being the reverse of that benediction which is given by the Hierophant in the fifth card. In the left hand there is a great flaming torch, inverted towards the earth. A reversed pentagram is on the forehead. There is a ring in front of the altar, from which two chains are carried to the necks of two figures, male and female. These are analogous with those of the fifth card, as if Adam and Eve after the Fall. Hereof is the chain and fatality of the material life.
