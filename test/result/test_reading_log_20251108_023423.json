After the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the person is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her to empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on the Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question I ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out loud to fix it more firmly in the mind. The method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must be thorough and some of the cards must become turned around to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I sometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor (many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they use to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all around, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person to bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this method carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ sents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible combinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck bears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ tering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back together, it carries the new pattern. With the cards mixed the subject must separate them into three piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she must remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then from that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down on the left.",

The latter are set aside in a heap, with the Querent, face upwards, on the top. The thirty-five cards, being shuffled and cut as before, are divided by dealing into six packets thus:-- Packet II consists of the SIX CARDS next following in order; Packet III consists of the FIVE CARDS following; Packet IV contains the next FOUR CARDS; Packet V contains Two CARDS; and Packet VI contains the last ELEVEN CARDS. The arrangement will then be as follows:-- Take up these packets successively; deal out the cards which they contain in six lines, which will be necessarily of unequal length. THE FIRST LINE stands for the house, the environment and so forth. THE SECOND LINE stands for the person or subject of the divination. THE THIRD LINE stands for what is passing outside, events, persons, etc. THE FOURTH LINE stands for a surprise, the unexpected, etc. THE FIFTH LINE stands for consolation, and may moderate all that is unfavourable in the preceding lines. THE SIXTH LINE is that which must be consulted to elucidate the enigmatic oracles of the others; apart from them it has no importance. These cards should all be read from left to right, beginning with the uppermost line. It should be stated in conclusion as to this divinatory part that there is no method of interpreting Tarot cards which is not applicable to ordinary playing-cards, but the additional court cards, and above all the Trumps Major,",

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner. In this method, the Querent--if of the male sex--is represented by the Magician, and if female by the High Priestess; but the card, in either case, is not taken from the pack until the forty-two cards have been laid out, as above directed.

All meanings are largely independent of one another and all are reduced, accentuated or subject to modification and sometimes almost reversal by their place in a sequence. There is scarcely any canon of criticism in matters of this kind. I suppose that in proportion as any system descends from generalities to details it becomes naturally the more precarious; and in the records of professional fortune-telling, it offers more of the dregs and lees of the subject. At the same time, divinations based on intuition and second sight are of little practical value unless they come down from the region of universals to that of particulars; but in proportion as this gift is present in a particular case, the specific meanings recorded by past cartomancists will be disregarded in favour of the personal appreciation of card values.

In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

              "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

              "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

In many readings (though certainly not all; see the Tree of Life method below) the cards are read individually, even though we attempt to combine the meanings, as in the Cross. In the Work Cycle, however, the positions include the idea of combinations. Readers who know Volume One of this book will remember that my interpretation of the Major Arcana divides the trumps into the Fool plus three lines of seven cards each, with each line showing a different stage of development. They may also remember that each line breaks down further into three parts. The first two cards signify the starting point for the line - the archetypes or basic qualities the person must use in going through the experiences shown in that line. The middle three stand for the basic work of the line - what the person must assimilate or overcome. The final two cards show the result. Thus, in the first line the Magician and the High Priestess indicate the basic archetypes of life. The Empress, the Emperor, and the I lierophant show the different aspects of the outer world facing us as we grow up. The Lovers and the Chariot symbolize the development of the successful individual. The Work Cycle borrows and adapts this tripartite structure. The reading begins w'ith choosing the Significator and mixing the cards in the same manner as with the Celtic Cross. Similarly, the first two cards from a small cross, interpreted much the same way as in the older method of reading, with perhaps more emphasis on the crossing card being an outcome or development of the Centre card. After the small cross the reader turns over seven cards in a row below the Significator rather than around it, with the",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential.

On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected.

The card represents a domestic environment filled with Fire optimism, eagerness, and celebration. As in the Six we see people following the dancers. Unlike that card, however, where the soldiers followed the charismatic leader, the people here are swept along by joy. They are leaving a walled city for the open bower. In other words, their spirit and courage carry them from a defensive situation to an open one. We can contrast this image with that of the Tower, shown on the right. The two figures in that Major card are dressed very similarly (even to blue and ied robes) to the two in the Four of W'ands. In its less esoteric meanings the lower shows the explosion that results when people allow a repressive or miserable situation to build up to an intolerable level. In the Four of Wands optimism and love of freedom carry the people, together, out of their walled city before it becomes a Tower-like prison. Waite calls this card unchanged upside down. The joy is so powerful it cannot be blocked. We can add, however, that the reversed Four might indicate, like the Sun in the Major Arcana, that the happiness in the environment is not so obvious. As with the family in the Ten of Pentacles, the people symbolized here may need to learn to appreciate what they have. Another possibility: the happiness in the person’s environment is just as strong, but unorthodox, at least in terms of other people’s attitudes and expectations.",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea.

Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future. There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend. Like the Seven, the Six reversed indicates a move towards action. Specifically, it shows looking towards the future, rather than the past. The two cards reversed are very similar; the difference is that the Six shows an attitude while the Seven indicates actual steps taken. At other times, depending on the right side up meaning, the Six reversed indicates disturbed memories (compare the Three of Wands reversed), or a feeling of alienation from the past. It can also show' the breakdown of a relationship based on one person protecting or teaching the other(s). The Fives concern struggle and sometimes pain.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "Usually the Basis does not show such a broad theme, but often it does indicate a previous situation, especially if a con¬ nection exists with the number or suit of one of the first two cards. Consider these three cards: the Magician crossed by the Five of Cups, with the Five of Swords beneath them (see Fig. 58). The Magician, as the person’s being, shows a strong, highly-creative and dynamic personality. The Five of Cups, however, indicates that the person is currently preoccupied with some loss so that the powerful personality has become subdued. In terms of the pictures, the Magician has covered his dazzling white and red robe in a black cloak. The Five of Swords, however, shows that the loss began as a painful and humiliating defeat. It is this defeat which has dimmed the Magician’s fire. But the move from Swords to Cups shows that already a process of renewal has begun. The person can begin to see the situation as one of regret rather than shame. What makes this movement possible is the Magician qualities, cur¬ rently concealed yet still active in the person’s life. The next card lies to the left of the small cross and bears the title ‘Recent Past’. The term is really a misnomer, for the difference between this position and the Basis lies not so much in the timescale as in their impact on the person. The Recent Past refers to events or situations that affect the subject, yet have passed or are passing out of importance. Usually it does refer to recent events; sometimes, however, it can show some thing reaching far back or of great importance. In the example above, of the woman whose father affected her so strongly, if the Emperor had appeared in the Recent Past instead",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Because he is the leader of his suit, he can symbolize success, achievement, mastery, and maturity in artistic work. More complex, and perhaps more troubled than the King of W'ands, the King of Cups reversed slides towards dishonesty. When right side up he uses his creativity for his work; reversed, he turns his talents to vice or corruption. Swindlers also use creativity to further their careers, but we would not describe them as ‘responsible’. The card upside down can mean that the violent Air emotions emerge from their calm exterior, perhaps through the pressure of outside events. Romantically, the King of Cups reversed can suggest a dishonest yet domineering lover, more often male, sometimes female. Finally, in relation to the arts, the King reversed can suggest that an artist’s achievement has proved to be insignificant, or that a person has not yet matured and cannot point to a significant body of work. In a reading, this final meaning would come out strongly if the card appeared in con¬ nection with certain Pentacles reversed, such as the Eight, or the Three.",

                "text": "The most successful and balanced of the Cups, in some ways of all the Minor cards, the Queen is almost a mundane version of the World Dancer. Coming between the outer responsibility of the King and the passiveness of the Knight, she shows the possibility of blending imagination and action, creativity and social usefulness. Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspira¬ tion for future activity from her or his past achievements. Compare her fierce gaze with the dreaminess of the Knight, or the cloudy fantasies of the Seven.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ ticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion.

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards.

Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her.

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses. However far we may travel in spiritual meditations we must begin and return here - or lose ourselves in the process. A famous Qabalistic tale illustrates this need for ‘groun¬ ding’.

One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now. The reversed Eight means, in general, liberation from some",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.",

We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold.

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter. Let it be supposed that the question is: Will a lawsuit be necessary? In this case, take the Trump No. 11, or justice, as the Significator. This has reference to legal affairs. But if the question is: Shall I be successful in my lawsuit? one of the Court Cards must be chosen as the Significator. Subsequently, consecutive divinations may be performed to ascertain the course of the process itself and its result to each of the parties concerned. Having selected the Significator, place it on the table, face upwards. Then shuffle and cut the rest of the pack three times, keeping the faces of the cards",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future. There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend. Like the Seven, the Six reversed indicates a move towards action. Specifically, it shows looking towards the future, rather than the past. The two cards reversed are very similar; the difference is that the Six shows an attitude while the Seven indicates actual steps taken. At other times, depending on the right side up meaning, the Six reversed indicates disturbed memories (compare the Three of Wands reversed), or a feeling of alienation from the past. It can also show' the breakdown of a relationship based on one person protecting or teaching the other(s). The Fives concern struggle and sometimes pain. With Wands we saw the adventure of competition; Cups show the emotional reaction to loss. The picture depicts sorrow",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers.

The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment.

After the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the person is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her to empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on the Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question I ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out loud to fix it more firmly in the mind. The method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must be thorough and some of the cards must become turned around to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I sometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor (many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they use to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all around, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person to bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this method carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ sents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible combinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck bears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ tering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back together, it carries the new pattern. With the cards mixed the subject must separate them into three piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she must remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then from that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down on the left.",

In many readings (though certainly not all; see the Tree of Life method below) the cards are read individually, even though we attempt to combine the meanings, as in the Cross. In the Work Cycle, however, the positions include the idea of combinations. Readers who know Volume One of this book will remember that my interpretation of the Major Arcana divides the trumps into the Fool plus three lines of seven cards each, with each line showing a different stage of development. They may also remember that each line breaks down further into three parts. The first two cards signify the starting point for the line - the archetypes or basic qualities the person must use in going through the experiences shown in that line. The middle three stand for the basic work of the line - what the person must assimilate or overcome. The final two cards show the result. Thus, in the first line the Magician and the High Priestess indicate the basic archetypes of life. The Empress, the Emperor, and the I lierophant show the different aspects of the outer world facing us as we grow up. The Lovers and the Chariot symbolize the development of the successful individual. The Work Cycle borrows and adapts this tripartite structure. The reading begins w'ith choosing the Significator and mixing the cards in the same manner as with the Celtic Cross. Similarly, the first two cards from a small cross, interpreted much the same way as in the older method of reading, with perhaps more emphasis on the crossing card being an outcome or development of the Centre card. After the small cross the reader turns over seven cards in a row below the Significator rather than around it, with the",

                "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs.

Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

However, if after interpreting this line, the reader and subject desire more information or simply another approach, the reader turns over a second line of seven directly below the first, and so on, until the meaning becomes clear. In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it.

The latter are set aside in a heap, with the Querent, face upwards, on the top. The thirty-five cards, being shuffled and cut as before, are divided by dealing into six packets thus:-- Packet II consists of the SIX CARDS next following in order; Packet III consists of the FIVE CARDS following; Packet IV contains the next FOUR CARDS; Packet V contains Two CARDS; and Packet VI contains the last ELEVEN CARDS. The arrangement will then be as follows:-- Take up these packets successively; deal out the cards which they contain in six lines, which will be necessarily of unequal length. THE FIRST LINE stands for the house, the environment and so forth. THE SECOND LINE stands for the person or subject of the divination. THE THIRD LINE stands for what is passing outside, events, persons, etc. THE FOURTH LINE stands for a surprise, the unexpected, etc. THE FIFTH LINE stands for consolation, and may moderate all that is unfavourable in the preceding lines. THE SIXTH LINE is that which must be consulted to elucidate the enigmatic oracles of the others; apart from them it has no importance.

There is scarcely any canon of criticism in matters of this kind. I suppose that in proportion as any system descends from generalities to details it becomes naturally the more precarious; and in the records of professional fortune-telling, it offers more of the dregs and lees of the subject. At the same time, divinations based on intuition and second sight are of little practical value unless they come down from the region of universals to that of particulars; but in proportion as this gift is present in a particular case, the specific meanings recorded by past cartomancists will be disregarded in favour of the personal appreciation of card values.

I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description.

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain.

In many readings (though certainly not all; see the Tree of Life method below) the cards are read individually, even though we attempt to combine the meanings, as in the Cross. In the Work Cycle, however, the positions include the idea of combinations. Readers who know Volume One of this book will remember that my interpretation of the Major Arcana divides the trumps into the Fool plus three lines of seven cards each, with each line showing a different stage of development. They may also remember that each line breaks down further into three parts. The first two cards signify the starting point for the line - the archetypes or basic qualities the person must use in going through the experiences shown in that line. The middle three stand for the basic work of the line - what the person must assimilate or overcome. The final two cards show the result. Thus, in the first line the Magician and the High Priestess indicate the basic archetypes of life. The Empress, the Emperor, and the I lierophant show the different aspects of the outer world facing us as we grow up. The Lovers and the Chariot symbolize the development of the successful individual. The Work Cycle borrows and adapts this tripartite structure. The reading begins w'ith choosing the Significator and mixing the cards in the same manner as with the Celtic Cross. Similarly, the first two cards from a small cross, interpreted much the same way as in the older method of reading, with perhaps more emphasis on the crossing card being an outcome or development of the Centre card. After the small cross the reader turns over seven cards in a row below the Significator rather than around it, with the",

The latter are set aside in a heap, with the Querent, face upwards, on the top. The thirty-five cards, being shuffled and cut as before, are divided by dealing into six packets thus:-- Packet II consists of the SIX CARDS next following in order; Packet III consists of the FIVE CARDS following; Packet IV contains the next FOUR CARDS; Packet V contains Two CARDS; and Packet VI contains the last ELEVEN CARDS. The arrangement will then be as follows:-- Take up these packets successively; deal out the cards which they contain in six lines, which will be necessarily of unequal length. THE FIRST LINE stands for the house, the environment and so forth. THE SECOND LINE stands for the person or subject of the divination. THE THIRD LINE stands for what is passing outside, events, persons, etc. THE FOURTH LINE stands for a surprise, the unexpected, etc. THE FIFTH LINE stands for consolation, and may moderate all that is unfavourable in the preceding lines. THE SIXTH LINE is that which must be consulted to elucidate the enigmatic oracles of the others; apart from them it has no importance. These cards should all be read from left to right, beginning with the uppermost line. It should be stated in conclusion as to this divinatory part that there is no method of interpreting Tarot cards which is not applicable to ordinary playing-cards, but the additional court cards, and above all the Trumps Major,",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.",

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

                "text": "to study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

                "text": "The resources of interpretation have been lavished, if not exhausted, on the twenty-two Trumps Major, the symbolism of which is unquestionable. There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter. Let it be supposed that the question is: Will a lawsuit be necessary? In this case, take the Trump No. 11, or justice, as the Significator. This has reference to legal affairs. But if the question is: Shall I be successful in my lawsuit? one of the Court Cards must be chosen as the Significator. Subsequently, consecutive divinations may be performed to ascertain the course of the process itself and its result to each of the parties concerned. Having selected the Significator, place it on the table, face upwards. Then shuffle and cut the rest of the pack three times, keeping the faces of the cards",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future. There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend. Like the Seven, the Six reversed indicates a move towards action. Specifically, it shows looking towards the future, rather than the past. The two cards reversed are very similar; the difference is that the Six shows an attitude while the Seven indicates actual steps taken. At other times, depending on the right side up meaning, the Six reversed indicates disturbed memories (compare the Three of Wands reversed), or a feeling of alienation from the past. It can also show' the breakdown of a relationship based on one person protecting or teaching the other(s). The Fives concern struggle and sometimes pain. With Wands we saw the adventure of competition; Cups show the emotional reaction to loss. The picture depicts sorrow",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ ticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of",

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity.

It will not be con¬ tained, and so we see people marching out ecstatically to the simplest of structures, trusting in the sun to burn off any clouds of trouble. The card represents a domestic environment filled with Fire optimism, eagerness, and celebration. As in the Six we see people following the dancers. Unlike that card, however, where the soldiers followed the charismatic leader, the people here are swept along by joy. They are leaving a walled city for the open bower. In other words, their spirit and courage carry them from a defensive situation to an open one. We can contrast this image with that of the Tower, shown on the right. The two figures in that Major card are dressed very similarly (even to blue and ied robes) to the two in the Four of W'ands. In its less esoteric meanings the lower shows the explosion that results when people allow a repressive or miserable situation to build up to an intolerable level. In the Four of Wands optimism and love of freedom carry the people, together, out of their walled city before it becomes a Tower-like prison. Waite calls this card unchanged upside down. The joy is so powerful it cannot be blocked. We can add, however, that the reversed Four might indicate, like the Sun in the Major Arcana, that the happiness in the environment is not so obvious. As with the family in the Ten of Pentacles, the people symbolized here may need to learn to appreciate what they have. Another possibility: the happiness in the person’s environment is just as strong, but unorthodox, at least in terms of other people’s attitudes and expectations.",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a person's emotional life, with a warm golden light. In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the",

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

                "text": "As cards of benevolent emotion and dreams the Cups signify sweet memories. Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future. There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend. Like the Seven, the Six reversed indicates a move towards action. Specifically, it shows looking towards the future, rather than the past. The two cards reversed are very similar; the difference is that the Six shows an attitude while the Seven indicates actual steps taken. At other times, depending on the right side up meaning, the Six reversed indicates disturbed memories (compare the Three of Wands reversed), or a feeling of alienation from the past. It can also show' the breakdown of a relationship based on one person protecting or teaching the other(s). The Fives concern struggle and sometimes pain. With Wands we saw the adventure of competition; Cups show the emotional reaction to loss. The picture depicts sorrow",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

                "text": "Usually the Basis does not show such a broad theme, but often it does indicate a previous situation, especially if a con¬ nection exists with the number or suit of one of the first two cards. Consider these three cards: the Magician crossed by the Five of Cups, with the Five of Swords beneath them (see Fig. 58). The Magician, as the person’s being, shows a strong, highly-creative and dynamic personality. The Five of Cups, however, indicates that the person is currently preoccupied with some loss so that the powerful personality has become subdued. In terms of the pictures, the Magician has covered his dazzling white and red robe in a black cloak. The Five of Swords, however, shows that the loss began as a painful and humiliating defeat. It is this defeat which has dimmed the Magician’s fire. But the move from Swords to Cups shows that already a process of renewal has begun. The person can begin to see the situation as one of regret rather than shame. What makes this movement possible is the Magician qualities, cur¬ rently concealed yet still active in the person’s life. The next card lies to the left of the small cross and bears the title ‘Recent Past’. The term is really a misnomer, for the difference between this position and the Basis lies not so much in the timescale as in their impact on the person. The Recent Past refers to events or situations that affect the subject, yet have passed or are passing out of importance. Usually it does refer to recent events; sometimes, however, it can show some thing reaching far back or of great importance. In the example above, of the woman whose father affected her so strongly, if the Emperor had appeared in the Recent Past instead",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

                "text": "But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit). By itself,",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life.

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom.

She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person.

Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration.

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses. However far we may travel in spiritual meditations we must begin and return here - or lose ourselves in the process. A famous Qabalistic tale illustrates this need for ‘groun¬ ding’. Through study and meditation four rabbis entered Paradise. Rabbi Ben Azai experienced such ecstasy that he",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

                "text": "From the Nine reversed we move to an even clearer image of oppression. We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now. The reversed Eight means, in general, liberation from some",

                "text": "As the yin aspect of the suit, the Queen of Swords symbolizes experiences of both sorrow and wisdom, and especially the connection between them. Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion.

From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action.

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "In some contexts, especially the arts, the King takes on a very different meaning. Because he is the leader of his suit, he can symbolize success, achievement, mastery, and maturity in artistic work. More complex, and perhaps more troubled than the King of W'ands, the King of Cups reversed slides towards dishonesty. When right side up he uses his creativity for his work; reversed, he turns his talents to vice or corruption. Swindlers also use creativity to further their careers, but we would not describe them as ‘responsible’. The card upside down can mean that the violent Air emotions emerge from their calm exterior, perhaps through the pressure of outside events. Romantically, the King of Cups reversed can suggest a dishonest yet domineering lover, more often male, sometimes female. Finally, in relation to the arts, the King reversed can suggest that an artist’s achievement has proved to be insignificant, or that a person has not yet matured and cannot point to a significant body of work. In a reading, this final meaning would come out strongly if the card appeared in con¬ nection with certain Pentacles reversed, such as the Eight, or the Three.",

Coming between the outer responsibility of the King and the passiveness of the Knight, she shows the possibility of blending imagination and action, creativity and social usefulness. Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspira¬ tion for future activity from her or his past achievements.

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ ticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

                "text": "Usually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

                "text": "The basic meaning of the card can change in three ways when reversed. First, it can mean not accepting the loss, and as an extension of this, false projects or mistakes. Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

After the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the person is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her to empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on the Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question I ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out loud to fix it more firmly in the mind. The method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must be thorough and some of the cards must become turned around to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I sometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor (many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they use to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all around, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person to bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this method carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ sents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible combinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck bears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ tering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back together, it carries the new pattern. With the cards mixed the subject must separate them into three piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she must remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then from that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down on the left.",

The latter are set aside in a heap, with the Querent, face upwards, on the top. The thirty-five cards, being shuffled and cut as before, are divided by dealing into six packets thus:-- Packet II consists of the SIX CARDS next following in order; Packet III consists of the FIVE CARDS following; Packet IV contains the next FOUR CARDS; Packet V contains Two CARDS; and Packet VI contains the last ELEVEN CARDS. The arrangement will then be as follows:-- Take up these packets successively; deal out the cards which they contain in six lines, which will be necessarily of unequal length. THE FIRST LINE stands for the house, the environment and so forth. THE SECOND LINE stands for the person or subject of the divination. THE THIRD LINE stands for what is passing outside, events, persons, etc. THE FOURTH LINE stands for a surprise, the unexpected, etc. THE FIFTH LINE stands for consolation, and may moderate all that is unfavourable in the preceding lines. THE SIXTH LINE is that which must be consulted to elucidate the enigmatic oracles of the others; apart from them it has no importance. These cards should all be read from left to right, beginning with the uppermost line.

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner.

There is scarcely any canon of criticism in matters of this kind. I suppose that in proportion as any system descends from generalities to details it becomes naturally the more precarious; and in the records of professional fortune-telling, it offers more of the dregs and lees of the subject. At the same time, divinations based on intuition and second sight are of little practical value unless they come down from the region of universals to that of particulars; but in proportion as this gift is present in a particular case, the specific meanings recorded by past cartomancists will be disregarded in favour of the personal appreciation of card values.

In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

              "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

              "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

              "text": "The third innovation involves reading cards in combina¬ tions. In many readings (though certainly not all; see the Tree of Life method below) the cards are read individually, even though we attempt to combine the meanings, as in the Cross. In the Work Cycle, however, the positions include the idea of combinations. Readers who know Volume One of this book will remember that my interpretation of the Major Arcana divides the trumps into the Fool plus three lines of seven cards each, with each line showing a different stage of development. They may also remember that each line breaks down further into three parts. The first two cards signify the starting point for the line - the archetypes or basic qualities the person must use in going through the experiences shown in that line. The middle three stand for the basic work of the line - what the person must assimilate or overcome. The final two cards show the result. Thus, in the first line the Magician and the High Priestess indicate the basic archetypes of life. The Empress, the Emperor, and the I lierophant show the different aspects of the outer world facing us as we grow up. The Lovers and the Chariot symbolize the development of the successful individual. The Work Cycle borrows and adapts this tripartite structure. The reading begins w'ith choosing the Significator and mixing the cards in the same manner as with the Celtic Cross. Similarly, the first two cards from a small cross, interpreted much the same way as in the older method of reading, with perhaps more emphasis on the crossing card being an outcome or development of the Centre card. After the small cross the reader turns over seven cards in a row below the Significator rather than around it, with the",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

It will not be con¬ tained, and so we see people marching out ecstatically to the simplest of structures, trusting in the sun to burn off any clouds of trouble. The card represents a domestic environment filled with Fire optimism, eagerness, and celebration. As in the Six we see people following the dancers. Unlike that card, however, where the soldiers followed the charismatic leader, the people here are swept along by joy. They are leaving a walled city for the open bower. In other words, their spirit and courage carry them from a defensive situation to an open one. We can contrast this image with that of the Tower, shown on the right. The two figures in that Major card are dressed very similarly (even to blue and ied robes) to the two in the Four of W'ands. In its less esoteric meanings the lower shows the explosion that results when people allow a repressive or miserable situation to build up to an intolerable level. In the Four of Wands optimism and love of freedom carry the people, together, out of their walled city before it becomes a Tower-like prison. Waite calls this card unchanged upside down. The joy is so powerful it cannot be blocked. We can add, however, that the reversed Four might indicate, like the Sun in the Major Arcana, that the happiness in the environment is not so obvious. As with the family in the Ten of Pentacles, the people symbolized here may need to learn to appreciate what they have. Another possibility: the happiness in the person’s environment is just as strong, but unorthodox, at least in terms of other people’s attitudes and expectations.",

                "text": "to study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers.

Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future. There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend. Like the Seven, the Six reversed indicates a move towards action. Specifically, it shows looking towards the future, rather than the past. The two cards reversed are very similar; the difference is that the Six shows an attitude while the Seven indicates actual steps taken. At other times, depending on the right side up meaning, the Six reversed indicates disturbed memories (compare the Three of Wands reversed), or a feeling of alienation from the past. It can also show' the breakdown of a relationship based on one person protecting or teaching the other(s). The Fives concern struggle and sometimes pain.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "Usually the Basis does not show such a broad theme, but often it does indicate a previous situation, especially if a con¬ nection exists with the number or suit of one of the first two cards. Consider these three cards: the Magician crossed by the Five of Cups, with the Five of Swords beneath them (see Fig. 58). The Magician, as the person’s being, shows a strong, highly-creative and dynamic personality. The Five of Cups, however, indicates that the person is currently preoccupied with some loss so that the powerful personality has become subdued. In terms of the pictures, the Magician has covered his dazzling white and red robe in a black cloak. The Five of Swords, however, shows that the loss began as a painful and humiliating defeat. It is this defeat which has dimmed the Magician’s fire. But the move from Swords to Cups shows that already a process of renewal has begun. The person can begin to see the situation as one of regret rather than shame. What makes this movement possible is the Magician qualities, cur¬ rently concealed yet still active in the person’s life. The next card lies to the left of the small cross and bears the title ‘Recent Past’. The term is really a misnomer, for the difference between this position and the Basis lies not so much in the timescale as in their impact on the person. The Recent Past refers to events or situations that affect the subject, yet have passed or are passing out of importance. Usually it does refer to recent events; sometimes, however, it can show some thing reaching far back or of great importance. In the example above, of the woman whose father affected her so strongly, if the Emperor had appeared in the Recent Past instead",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Because he is the leader of his suit, he can symbolize success, achievement, mastery, and maturity in artistic work. More complex, and perhaps more troubled than the King of W'ands, the King of Cups reversed slides towards dishonesty. When right side up he uses his creativity for his work; reversed, he turns his talents to vice or corruption. Swindlers also use creativity to further their careers, but we would not describe them as ‘responsible’. The card upside down can mean that the violent Air emotions emerge from their calm exterior, perhaps through the pressure of outside events. Romantically, the King of Cups reversed can suggest a dishonest yet domineering lover, more often male, sometimes female. Finally, in relation to the arts, the King reversed can suggest that an artist’s achievement has proved to be insignificant, or that a person has not yet matured and cannot point to a significant body of work. In a reading, this final meaning would come out strongly if the card appeared in con¬ nection with certain Pentacles reversed, such as the Eight, or the Three.",

                "text": "The most successful and balanced of the Cups, in some ways of all the Minor cards, the Queen is almost a mundane version of the World Dancer. Coming between the outer responsibility of the King and the passiveness of the Knight, she shows the possibility of blending imagination and action, creativity and social usefulness. Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspira¬ tion for future activity from her or his past achievements. Compare her fierce gaze with the dreaminess of the Knight, or the cloudy fantasies of the Seven.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ ticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

                "text": "But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship.

Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion.

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents.

The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards.

The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants.

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses.

One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

                "text": "From the Nine reversed we move to an even clearer image of oppression. We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now. The reversed Eight means, in general, liberation from some",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than ...\n\n[2] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.70)\nAs cards of benevolent emotion and dreams the Cups signify sweet memories. Sometimes these memories truly represent the past; at other times we may idealize the past and see it through a haze of security and happiness. The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In...\n\n[3] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.68)\nThe Ace of Swords, as the Outcome card showed the strong attitude as well as the sharp perceptive mind she would need, and find, to open up the current situation. The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards ...\n\n[4] [pkt.txt] (相似度: 0.68)\nA man of dejected aspect is deserting the cups of his felicity, enterprise, undertaking or previous concern. Divinatory Meanings: The card speaks for itself on the surface, but other readings are entirely antithetical--giving joy, mildness, timidity, honour, modesty. In practice, it is usually found that the card shews the decline of a matter, or that a matter which has been thought to be important is really of slight consequence--either for good or evil. Reversed: Great joy, happiness, feasting...\n\n[5] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.67)\nFire implies swiftness and movement. Though this movement sometimes lacks direction we see here the image of a journey reaching an end, or things completed. When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, ...\n\n[6] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.67)\nIn astrology and Jungian thought the elements stand for types and characteristics. In the Tarot we see these types reflected in the court cards. The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or...\n\n[7] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.67)\nThere are two basic variants here. First, all the emotion turns against itself. Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wan...\n\n[8] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.67)\nThe basic meaning of the card can change in three ways when reversed. First, it can mean not accepting the loss, and as an extension of this, false projects or mistakes. Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of...\n\n[9] [pkt.txt] (相似度: 0.67)\nA hoodwinked female figure balances two swords upon her shoulders. Divinatory Meanings: Conformity and the equipoise which it suggests, courage, friendship, concord in a state of arms; another reading gives tenderness, affection, intimacy. The suggestion of harmony and other favourable readings must be considered in a qualified manner, as Swords generally are not symbolical of beneficent forces in human affairs. Reversed: Imposture, falsehood, duplicity, disloyalty. The Pictorial Key to the Taro...\n\n[10] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.67)\nDrawing on another well-known symbolic system Wands and Swords represent ‘yang' or ‘active' situations, while Cups and Pentacles stand for ‘yin - or ‘passive' ones. We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either ma...\n\n[11] [pkt.txt] (相似度: 0.66)\nA dark, cloaked figure, looking sideways at three prone cups two others stand upright behind him; a bridge is in the background, leading to a small keep or holding. Divanatory Meanings: It is a card of loss, but something remains over; three have been taken, but two are left; it is a card of inheritance, patrimony, transmission, but not corresponding to expectations; with some interpreters it is a card of marriage, but not without bitterness or frustration. Reversed: News, alliances, affinity, c...\n\n[12] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.66)\nwinning, staying on top. While the fight goes on we enjoy it. People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of hi...\n\n[13] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nBut if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal term...\n\n[14] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nWhen we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of wha...\n\n[15] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nThe number three, because it joins one and two in a new reality (see the Empress in the Major Arcana) indicates com¬ binations and achievements. In each suit it shows that element in its maturity. With Wands this becomes accomplishment. The figure is shown strong, but at rest, unthreatened. The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships ...\n\n[16] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nto study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than polit...\n\n[17] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nIn some contexts, especially the arts, the King takes on a very different meaning. Because he is the leader of his suit, he can symbolize success, achievement, mastery, and maturity in artistic work. More complex, and perhaps more troubled than the King of W'ands, the King of Cups reversed slides towards dishonesty. When right side up he uses his creativity for his work; reversed, he turns his talents to vice or corruption. Swindlers also use creativity to further their careers, but we would not...\n\n[18] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nsuit of Wands, with its emphasis on action, contains fewer of these inner cards than any of the other suits). Metaphysically the sea has always evoked in people a sense of the vast ness and mystery of the universe, while rivers symbolize the experience of the ego dissolving into that great Sea. The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schem...\n\n[19] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.65)\nBefore the reading I remarked to the woman that the Three of Cups often appears in such situations, right side up if it is going well, reversed if it is not. The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out.

The Pictorial Key to the Tarot...\n\n[21] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (相似度: 0.63)\nBriefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the ...\n\n[22] [pkt.txt] (相似度: 0.63)\nA prostrate figure, pierced by all the swords belonging to the card.

The irrepressible Wands energy, however, requires no protective fences as does, say, Pentacles. It will not be con¬ tained, and so we see people marching out ecstatically to the simplest of structures, trusting in the sun to burn off any clouds of trouble. The card represents a domestic environment filled with Fire optimism, eagerness, and celebration. As in the Six we see people following the dancers.

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology.

Even very practised readers will often find the alternatives confusing. After the choice of Significator comes the mixing.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life.
