You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain.

In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question.

              "text": "Another example will help illustrate this most valuable part of a Celtic Cross reading. The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or her. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ tunity. I have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In some readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with the others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms ’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- tions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as the Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of history, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian mystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through meditation on the cross and other methods of identification with Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the horizontal facts of their own physical existences. In many other cultures the image of a cross symbolizes the four horizontal directions along the surface of the earth, while the centre, the meeting place of the four, suggests the essentially vertical direction of the centre. The cross, therefore, also sym¬ bolizes the Tarot itself, the four arms being the four suits and the centre the Major Arcana.",

              "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

As if in response to the troubles shown on the previous card the man has given himself a protective layer against any economic (or other) problems that might arise in the future. However, while the Five showed two people, here we see one person, excluding others through his need for personal security. As magic signs the pentacles symbolize basic emotional/ psychic energy. The man here uses his pentacles to close himself off from the outside world. He has covered his most vital points: the crown of the head (literally a crown here), the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet. People working with chakra meditation will recognize the first two as vital points of connection to Spirit, and to other people. Covering the feet symbolizes blocking ourselves off from the world around us. The man cannot, however, seal his back. We always remain vulnerable to life, no matter how self-centred we fry to make ourselves. In certain situations, the Four, usually viewed as a ‘problem' card, becomes very appropriate. When life has broken down into chaos, then the Four indicates creating a structure, either through material things, or by turning emotional and mental energy inwards. The card remains an image of selfishness but sometimes selfishness may be pre¬ cisely what is needed. People who meditate through their auras will usually, at the end of each meditation, follow a ritual of‘sealing' the aura at the chakra points. This practice prevents both a leaking of their own energy and a Hooding of the self by outside influences.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together.

Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "to study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not under¬ stand why anyone would express negative attitudes. Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, ‘If 1 can do it you can’.

Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo. and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

In a reading the card signifies that the person is successfully controlling some situation through the force of his or her personality. The card implies that a situation contains some contradictions and that these have not been brought together but simply held under control. This is not to stress too highly the negative undertones of the card. When it is the right way up the Chariot basically means success; the personality in charge of the world around it. If it appears as the outcome in a reading dealing with problems then it indicates victory-. Reversed, the card’s inherent contradictions gain greater force. The Chariot upside down implies that the approach of will-power has proven unsuccessful, and the situation has got out of control. Unless the person can find some other approach to the difficulties, he or she faces disaster. Will-power alone cannot always sustain us. Like Oedipus we must sometimes learn to give way to the gods. ith the second line of the Major Arcana we move from the outer world and its challenges to the inner self. The contradictions concealed in the Chariot’s powerful image must now be faced openly. The mask of ego must die.",

                "text": "While this book will deal extensively with the concepts embodied in the cards and their symbolism it will also look carefully at the application of these concepts to Tarot readings. Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience. Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental - forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way. Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.",

A great many mystics and shamans have said that their visions showed them how all things connect, how everything fits together, because the spirit unites the entire universe. Possibly we would all see and understand this grand scheme of life, if it were not for the fact that we do not live long enough. Our short lives narrow our vision to such a miniscule portion of the world that life appears meaningless. Now, this idea of the Wheel as the mystery of fate, with its hidden meaning, fits very well the modern Waite-Smith version of the card, especially when we consider it as halfway to the final trump. If we place the Rider pack Wheel beside the World we see immediately the link between them. In one we have a wheel filled with symbols; in the other we find a wreath of victory, and inside it a dancer who embodies the truth behind the symbols. Even more striking, we find the same four animals on each card in the corners, except that the mythological beings of card 10 have been transformed into something real and alive in the World. Thus, at the halfway point, we receive a vision of the inner meaning of life; at the end that vision has become real, embodied in our own being.",

The unconscious known consciously, the outer self unified with the forces of life, knowledge that is not knowledge at all but a constant ecstatic dance of being - they are all true and yet not true. We have already observed a great deal about this card and its images. The number as well as the two wands unify the Magician and the High Priestess. We saw the World foreshadowed as well in the Wheel of Fortune, and reflected how the symbols of that trump are now living realities. One way or another, the Wheel has come up for virtually every card in the last line. The purpose of this line can be described as that of uniting ourselves with all those things seen in trump 10 as external vision, that is, fate, the workings of life, the elements of existence. When the unity is achieved the symbols vanish, dissolved into a dancing spirit. We saw the World in the Hanged Man, by number and picture. Trump 12 maintained its bliss through complete inactivity. But even the World Tree is an illusion created by the mind’s need to grasp onto something. When we have dissolved our isolated selves into that water lying beneath the Hanged Man’s glowing face we learn that true unity lies in movement. Everything in the universe moves, the Earth around the sun, the sun within the galaxy, the galaxies in clusters, all cycling around each other. There is no centre, no place where we can say, ‘Here it all began, here it all stops.’ Yet the centre exists, everywhere, for in a dance the dancer does not move around any arbitrary point in space, but rather the dance carries its own sense of unity",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

No matter how absolute a quality may seem to us in the abstract, in reality it affects us only in the context of other influences. Readings demonstrate this fact in a practical way, as with the woman trying to deal with her lover’s jealousy. A card usually thought of as positive, the Sun, actually tended towards a bad result, for by hoping for the Sun she did not face the needs of the situation, and in fact allowed other people’s ideas to dictate what she wanted. Along with context we learn the ways in which the elements of life balance each other. We see first of all how the suits and specific cards combine to form a unified situation with no suit better or worse than any of the others. Astrologers often find that clients hope for certain signs and elements to dominate their charts, and will show disappointment or even shame if others appear. Similarly, for some people who know a little about Tarot, if a reading shows a lot of Wands, or Cups, they will feel comfor¬ ted; if it showed Swords they will become frightened; and if it shows Fentacles they will think of it as trivial, even insulting. Some will only accept a reading which contains many Major cards, because only the trumps, with their implications of power and spiritual awareness, appear important to them. But even the Major Arcana forms only one element, meaningless without the others. We study it in isolation for its wisdom and powerful description of existence. But in practice we need to mix the spiritual with the mundane, the happy with the sad, love and anger together to understand the world.",

                "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

                "text": "If any device will provide meaning, why Tarot? The answer is, any system will tell us something, but the quality of that something depends on the values contained in the system. The Tarot contains a philosophy, an outline of how human con¬ sciousness evolves, and a vast compendium of human experience. Shuffling the cards brings all these values into play with each other. We might argue that assigning a philosophy to the cards destroys their objectivity in terms of predicting events. Human values and interpretations have intruded in an otherwise.pure system. Such an idea, I think, would come from a misunder¬ standing of ‘objectivity’. The Tarot is objective because it bypasses conscious decision, but it is not impartial. On the contrary, it attempts to push us in certain directions: optimism, spirituality, a belief in the necessity and value of change. The meanings for the cards given in this book leave a good deal of room for interpretation by the reader. In fact, they require it. This is because the practised reader brings far more to her or his work than a detailed knowledge of the cards and their traditional meanings. Just as important is sensitivity - both to the pictures and to the person sitting there nervously and excitedly staring at the cards. A good reader does not simply repeat traditional fixed meanings. Rather, he or she will find new meanings and interpretations, will extend the patterns. While some people desire objective readings and dislike interpretation, others argue that a reader should not use any definite meanings at all, but always work from ‘feeling' the pictures at the moment. Yet to do so will limit the reader to the narrow range of his or her own perceptions. And those perceptions will always come at least partly from his or her",

Using the Tarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very tricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, usually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other systems. I have found it better to get a more general picture from the line, looking not just at physical condition but also emotional, spiritual health. One recommendation - observe which elements dominate. Strong Wands suggest good general health through the person’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie Nine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. Cups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual condition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker health or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for instance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of Major cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ ding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, would indicate good general health, Temperance would indicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- sickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can symbolize some special situation that has appeared or will appear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in the whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the beginning reader. The third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly the imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked at the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and awareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made conscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ tions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle level - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link between the two.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

Does it mean we create or control everything that happens to us? As in the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ sibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us entirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot readings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any moment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a very short person cannot expect to become a professional basketball player, so that same person must not consider his whole life dominated by height. People who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which counts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one really controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the meaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some readings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly dominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the determining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ ticular situation. Tarot readings help us develop confidence in our own perceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, and partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. Which of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case?

More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it. Keep your eyes closed or opened, depending on what works for you; most people find that at least when the fantasy starts they prefer their eyes closed. Try to",

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life.

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

Like the Ten of Cups it deals with domestic life, but where the men and women in Cups celebrate the gift, the family here does not notice the magic all around them. On the surface the card represents the established home, the good life, a secure and comfortable position in the world. The people concerned, however, appear to take the comfort for granted; they find the security boring or stifling. In contrast to the Ten of Cups (the two cards will often appear together in readings) the family here does not seem to communicate with each other. The man and woman face opposite ways, though the woman glances anxiously over her shoulder at the man. The child hangs on nervously to its mother, but looks away. And none of them notices the old man outside the arch. Though the card expresses mundaneness, magic signs cover it. The ten pentacles form the Qabalistic Tree of Life, some¬ thing which appears nowhere else in the deck. Notice also the magic wand resting against the arch; no other Minor card contains one. The arch itself bears a relief of balanced scales (just above the old man’s head). Now, scales stand for Justice, and further, for subtle forces which keep the everyday world from breaking into chaos. By ‘subtle forces’ I do not mean only so-called ‘occult’ laws, such as polarity, or the law of correspondences (as above, so below). The term applies also to nature’s generally more accepted workings, such as gravity, or electro-magnetism. Because we learn about these in school we should not consider such phenomena as any the less marvellous. The fact is, we all",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

                "text": "Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

What attitudes does the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect the situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a reading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position shows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the subject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship indicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile behaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome would indicate the result of the conflict. Just as the subject affects the reading so also do the people and general situations around him or her. We call the eighth card the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court card appears in this position it will usually mean a person influencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either the effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ tion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping or hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For instance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands reversed in the Environment would suggest that an atmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ tion is making work unpleasant. Sometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather than other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his surroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of Swords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of retreating from conflicts with the people around him.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of. seif-trust will often prove the most important. If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life. In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work. The Knight's responsibility for action brings",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal. Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action. The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side. The Five reversed brings to mind again that phrase 'the fire has gone out’. The number four, with its image of the square, implies stasis",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers.

For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea.

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duality of Hopes and Fears shows up most strongly in cards dealing with change, or the emergence from confined situations to open ones. Death, the Eight of Cups, the Two of Wands reversed, and the Four of Wands all deal with these themes of freedom and change. Some others are the Devil reversed, the Eight of Swords reversed, and the Star. Very often if the subject and the reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of these images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence will emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. Because the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or success), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains hidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this ambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or she really wants. Seeing this duality at work in one reading after another teaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning.

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "The image in Fig. 48(b), slightly different from the official Rider version (Fig. 48(a)), comes from an American edition of several years ago. In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold.

The mind sees so many sides to a situation, so many possibilities, that understanding, let alone action, becomes impossible. Because our culture has always emphasized rationality, many people today see thinking in general as the cause of all life's problems. If we just stop thinking, they tell us, then everything will work out all right. Even if such a thing were possible, the Tarot tells us it would not benefit us. We do not overcome the problem of an element by banishing it or replacing it with something, but rather by combining it with other elements. The fact is, the more confused we are the more we need our minds, because nothing else can sort out the truth. We need also, however, to combine Air with Water - that is, emotion with receptivity. We need also to combine it with Ether, Spirit, the deep values grounded in spiritual/psychological truth that we see em¬ bodied in the Major Arcana. Then the problem of Air changes to the Way, wisdom. The more obvious problem shown in Swords is that of sorrow, pain, anger - the stormy side of Air. We cannot overcome these things by ignoring them, but we can add to Swords the optimism of Wands, and we can use Pentacles to take ourselves out of our emotions through an involvement with work, nature, the outside world.",

Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

But if a more difficult problem is involved, then the Page's practice becomes hard to maintain. It requires ‘vigilance’ to use Waite’s term, making sure that people or situations do not get too close. Much of the Page’s energy goes to looking over his shoulder. As a somewhat aged student, Hamlet embodied the Page's attitude of observation and irony. His situation, however, called for the aggressive approach of the Knight. Because of his detached quality the Page can sometimes indulge himself in spying on people, either literally, or figuratively, as an attitude to life. In other words, he may look on human life as a kind of curious spectacle in which he himself does not expect to take part. Here we see the effect of the Page’s aloof attitude in a situation that requires more force. The vigilance turns to paranoia; everyone appears to be an enemy- What began as a feeling of ‘I’m above all that, I don’t need to concern myself with that,’ becomes an obsession with problems and a seeming inability to do anything about them. Such feelings of weakness art- endemic to Swords; they require Wands for courage and optimism. From the blue skies of the court cards to the black gloom of the Ten and Nine. Just as the Ten of Cups showed joy overflow¬ ing, so the Ten of Swords fills us with pain. Despite the extreme picture the card does not represent death, or even especially violence.

But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

What attitudes does the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect the situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a reading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position shows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the subject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship indicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile behaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome would indicate the result of the conflict. Just as the subject affects the reading so also do the people and general situations around him or her. We call the eighth card the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court card appears in this position it will usually mean a person influencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either the effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ tion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping or hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For instance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands reversed in the Environment would suggest that an atmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ tion is making work unpleasant. Sometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather than other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his surroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of Swords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of retreating from conflicts with the people around him.",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses. However far we may travel in spiritual meditations we must begin and return here - or lose ourselves in the process. A famous Qabalistic tale illustrates this need for ‘groun¬ ding’.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

                "text": "Now, the cover card usually stands for some basic influence on the subject, a general situation or starting point for the reading. The second card, which we always read right side up, despite how it comes off the deck, represents in traditional systems an ‘opposing influence’, something counter to the first. In practice, this ‘opposition’ may actually form a second influence supporting the first. For example, suppose the cover card was the Fool, indicat¬ ing a sense of following instincts despite what may seem the more sensible practice. If Temperance crossed it, we could call it an opposition, since Temperance usually refers to caution. But if the Knight of Wands crossed the Fool, the two cards would tend to support each other, and in fact the other cards might suggest a need for a more temperate influence to balance all that eagerness. In my work I have developed a slightly different way of looking at the first two cards, referring to them not as cover and ‘opposition’ but as ‘Centre’ and ‘crossing’. For their meanings I term them the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ aspects, or some¬ times ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ time, or simply ‘being’ and ‘doing’. The Centre card shows some basic quality of the person or the person’s situation. I'he crossing card then shows how that quality affects the person, or how it translates into action. Put another way, the first shows what the person is, the second how he or she acts. Consider the example in Fig. 57. The Fool would indicate a person with an inner tendency to take chances, to follow instinct. Temperance crossing it would mean that when it comes to action the person tends towards a more careful approach, blending instinctive energy with more practical considerations.",

Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help. Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, one's true plans or intentions. The isolation turns around to become communication, in par¬ ticular seeking advice on what to do about one's problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the act of finding help, such as consult¬ ing a reader or a therapist or simply friends. Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to deter¬ mine which course - independence or seeking advice — will produce the best results. A strange and powerful image, this card more than any other illustrates how Pamela Smith’s images reach beyond Arthur Waite's formulas.

The cards showed the journey and its hoped for end. For the top corners we used the Eight of Swords reversed and the King of Wands reversed - the desired action and the attitude needed to produce it. Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.",

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

              "text": "In the Tarot we see the four elements as Fire-Wands (Staves), Water-Cups, Air-Swords, Earth-Pentacles (Coins). Different writers sometimes give variations on this listing, most often switching Wands and Fentacles, on the grounds that sticks grow out of the earth, and coins are forged in a fire. I have chosen to stay with the more common listing because of the wider associations of fire and earth. Fire is not simply a human tool, but a great force in nature, seen most powerfully in the sun which brings the staves out of the ground. Earth stands not only for the soil, but traditionally for the entire material universe of which Coins represent a small part and Pentacles a much wider part. If we wish to see the world in terms of five rather than four, including Spirit centre, then the Major Arcana stands for Ether, the fifth element. The fact that we set it apart from the four Minor elements symbolizes the intuition that Spirit somehow exists on a different level from the ordinary world. At the same time the fact that we mix all five together for readings helps us see that in reality Spirit and all the elements of matter constantly work together. Working with the Tarot helps us understand the dynamic ways in which Spirit gives meaning and unity to the material world. A true understan¬ ding of this relationship, in practice as well as theory, forms a great step towards that 'mastery’ described earlier. Many people will know the imagery of the four elements from astrology, with its four ‘triplicities’: Fire - Aries, Leo, Sagittarius; Water - Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; Air - Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; Earth - Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn. Jungian psychology also utilizes the four elements, linking them to basic ways of experiencing the world. Fire stands",

There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.",

Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

There is no especial idea connected on the surface with the ordinary court cards; they are a bridge of conventions, which form a transition to the simple pretexts of the counters and denaries of the numbers following. We seem to have passed away utterly from the region of higher meanings illustrated by living pictures. There in was a period, however, when the numbered cards were also pictures, but such devices were sporadic inventions of particular artists and were either conventional designs of the typical or allegorical kind, distinct from what is understood by symbolism, or they were illustrations--shall we say?--of manners, customs and periods. They were, in a word, adornments, and as such they did nothing to raise the significance of the Lesser Arcana to the plane of the Trumps Major; moreover, such variations are exceedingly few. This notwithstanding, there are vague rumours concerning a higher meaning in the minor cards, but nothing has so far transpired, even within the sphere of prudence which belongs to the most occult circles; these, it is true, have certain variants in respect of divinatory values, but I have not heard that in practice they offer better results.

Precisely because it shows ordinary life rather than a formal system the Rider pack does not appeal to many occultists. While a great many subsequent decks have copied, with small or large variations, the Rider pack, other decks, including ones we might characterize as 'most serious', such as the Crowley or the Builders of the Adytum deck, have returned to the use of patterns for the pip cards.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

While this is often the case, they can also symbolize the subject him or herself. Taken by themselves, that is, outside the context of specific readings, the sixteen court cards provide a greater range of human character. Either in a reading or by itself as an object of study any specific court card indicates a person having or expressing those qualities signified by that card. A King (or a Knight or a Page) does not necessarily mean a man, nor a Queen a woman. Rather, they show qualities and attitudes traditionally symbolized by those figures. The par¬ ticular social functions of a king, or a queen, or a knight, suggest certain experiences and responsibilities. The cards symbolize these as often as they stand for age or sex. We should also avoid the idea that a card might symbolize an individual person throughout life, in the sense of saying about someone, l She’s the Queen of Wands’, and thinking that sums up her life. A person might go through a Queen of Swords phase one month, and move to a Knight of Cups the next. Or experience both at once, in different aspects of her life at that time. A king is a ruler, responsible for the welfare of society. In the Rider pack all four Kings wear what Waite calls ‘a cap of maintenance’ underneath their crowns. Traditionally the king bears responsibility for maintaining his people. Therefore, all the Kings represent both success (for the king, after all, is supreme) and social responsibility. The King of Wands translates these qualities into Wands terms. He indicates a strong-minded person, able to dominate others by strength of will. His power derives from a firm belief",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her.

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana.

You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question.

I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner. In this method, the Querent--if of the male sex--is represented by the Magician, and if female by the High Priestess; but the card, in either case, is not taken from the pack until the forty-two cards have been laid out, as above directed.

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question. Before leaving the Celtic Cross I would like to present a sample reading done by me some months before writing",

You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.",

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

                "text": "In the Tarot we see the four elements as Fire-Wands (Staves), Water-Cups, Air-Swords, Earth-Pentacles (Coins). Different writers sometimes give variations on this listing, most often switching Wands and Fentacles, on the grounds that sticks grow out of the earth, and coins are forged in a fire. I have chosen to stay with the more common listing because of the wider associations of fire and earth. Fire is not simply a human tool, but a great force in nature, seen most powerfully in the sun which brings the staves out of the ground. Earth stands not only for the soil, but traditionally for the entire material universe of which Coins represent a small part and Pentacles a much wider part. If we wish to see the world in terms of five rather than four, including Spirit centre, then the Major Arcana stands for Ether, the fifth element. The fact that we set it apart from the four Minor elements symbolizes the intuition that Spirit somehow exists on a different level from the ordinary world. At the same time the fact that we mix all five together for readings helps us see that in reality Spirit and all the elements of matter constantly work together. Working with the Tarot helps us understand the dynamic ways in which Spirit gives meaning and unity to the material world. A true understan¬ ding of this relationship, in practice as well as theory, forms a great step towards that 'mastery’ described earlier. Many people will know the imagery of the four elements from astrology, with its four ‘triplicities’: Fire - Aries, Leo, Sagittarius; Water - Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; Air - Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; Earth - Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn. Jungian psychology also utilizes the four elements, linking them to basic ways of experiencing the world. Fire stands",

There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter. Let it be supposed that the question is: Will a lawsuit be necessary? In this case, take the Trump No. 11, or justice, as the Significator. This has reference to legal affairs. But if the question is: Shall I be successful in my lawsuit? one of the Court Cards must be chosen as the Significator. Subsequently, consecutive divinations may be performed to ascertain the course of the process itself and its result to each of the parties concerned.

Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

There is no especial idea connected on the surface with the ordinary court cards; they are a bridge of conventions, which form a transition to the simple pretexts of the counters and denaries of the numbers following. We seem to have passed away utterly from the region of higher meanings illustrated by living pictures. There in was a period, however, when the numbered cards were also pictures, but such devices were sporadic inventions of particular artists and were either conventional designs of the typical or allegorical kind, distinct from what is understood by symbolism, or they were illustrations--shall we say?--of manners, customs and periods. They were, in a word, adornments, and as such they did nothing to raise the significance of the Lesser Arcana to the plane of the Trumps Major; moreover, such variations are exceedingly few. This notwithstanding, there are vague rumours concerning a higher meaning in the minor cards, but nothing has so far transpired, even within the sphere of prudence which belongs to the most occult circles; these, it is true, have certain variants in respect of divinatory values, but I have not heard that in practice they offer better results.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

While this is often the case, they can also symbolize the subject him or herself. Taken by themselves, that is, outside the context of specific readings, the sixteen court cards provide a greater range of human character. Either in a reading or by itself as an object of study any specific court card indicates a person having or expressing those qualities signified by that card. A King (or a Knight or a Page) does not necessarily mean a man, nor a Queen a woman. Rather, they show qualities and attitudes traditionally symbolized by those figures. The par¬ ticular social functions of a king, or a queen, or a knight, suggest certain experiences and responsibilities. The cards symbolize these as often as they stand for age or sex. We should also avoid the idea that a card might symbolize an individual person throughout life, in the sense of saying about someone, l She’s the Queen of Wands’, and thinking that sums up her life. A person might go through a Queen of Swords phase one month, and move to a Knight of Cups the next. Or experience both at once, in different aspects of her life at that time. A king is a ruler, responsible for the welfare of society. In the Rider pack all four Kings wear what Waite calls ‘a cap of maintenance’ underneath their crowns. Traditionally the king bears responsibility for maintaining his people. Therefore, all the Kings represent both success (for the king, after all, is supreme) and social responsibility. The King of Wands translates these qualities into Wands terms. He indicates a strong-minded person, able to dominate others by strength of will. His power derives from a firm belief",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter. Let it be supposed that the question is: Will a lawsuit be necessary? In this case, take the Trump No. 11, or justice, as the Significator. This has reference to legal affairs. But if the question is: Shall I be successful in my lawsuit? one of the Court Cards must be chosen as the Significator. Subsequently, consecutive divinations may be performed to ascertain the course of the process itself and its result to each of the parties concerned.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a person's emotional life, with a warm golden light. In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses. However far we may travel in spiritual meditations we must begin and return here - or lose ourselves in the process. A famous Qabalistic tale illustrates this need for ‘groun¬ ding’.

                "text": "But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit). By itself,",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent.

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses. However far we may travel in spiritual meditations we must begin and return here - or lose ourselves in the process. A famous Qabalistic tale illustrates this need for ‘groun¬ ding’. Through study and meditation four rabbis entered Paradise. Rabbi Ben Azai experienced such ecstasy that he",

In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

The second card, which we always read right side up, despite how it comes off the deck, represents in traditional systems an ‘opposing influence’, something counter to the first. In practice, this ‘opposition’ may actually form a second influence supporting the first. For example, suppose the cover card was the Fool, indicat¬ ing a sense of following instincts despite what may seem the more sensible practice. If Temperance crossed it, we could call it an opposition, since Temperance usually refers to caution. But if the Knight of Wands crossed the Fool, the two cards would tend to support each other, and in fact the other cards might suggest a need for a more temperate influence to balance all that eagerness. In my work I have developed a slightly different way of looking at the first two cards, referring to them not as cover and ‘opposition’ but as ‘Centre’ and ‘crossing’. For their meanings I term them the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ aspects, or some¬ times ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ time, or simply ‘being’ and ‘doing’. The Centre card shows some basic quality of the person or the person’s situation. I'he crossing card then shows how that quality affects the person, or how it translates into action. Put another way, the first shows what the person is, the second how he or she acts. Consider the example in Fig. 57. The Fool would indicate a person with an inner tendency to take chances, to follow instinct. Temperance crossing it would mean that when it comes to action the person tends towards a more careful approach, blending instinctive energy with more practical considerations.",

Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

                "text": "The theme of struggle continues. Here we see an image of taking action against problems. Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help. Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, one's true plans or intentions. The isolation turns around to become communication, in par¬ ticular seeking advice on what to do about one's problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the act of finding help, such as consult¬ ing a reader or a therapist or simply friends. Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to deter¬ mine which course - independence or seeking advice — will produce the best results. A strange and powerful image, this card more than any other illustrates how Pamela Smith’s images reach beyond Arthur Waite's formulas.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art.

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

                "text": "Briefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

                "text": "To the right stand a monk and an architect holding the plans of the church. Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

As if in response to the troubles shown on the previous card the man has given himself a protective layer against any economic (or other) problems that might arise in the future. However, while the Five showed two people, here we see one person, excluding others through his need for personal security. As magic signs the pentacles symbolize basic emotional/ psychic energy. The man here uses his pentacles to close himself off from the outside world. He has covered his most vital points: the crown of the head (literally a crown here), the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet. People working with chakra meditation will recognize the first two as vital points of connection to Spirit, and to other people. Covering the feet symbolizes blocking ourselves off from the world around us. The man cannot, however, seal his back. We always remain vulnerable to life, no matter how self-centred we fry to make ourselves. In certain situations, the Four, usually viewed as a ‘problem' card, becomes very appropriate. When life has broken down into chaos, then the Four indicates creating a structure, either through material things, or by turning emotional and mental energy inwards. The card remains an image of selfishness but sometimes selfishness may be pre¬ cisely what is needed. People who meditate through their auras will usually, at the end of each meditation, follow a ritual of‘sealing' the aura at the chakra points. This practice prevents both a leaking of their own energy and a Hooding of the self by outside influences.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together.

Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold.

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

The adventurous Wands nature can make such a person uncomfortable in this role. He leans forward on his throne, as if he would like to leap up and go to seek new experience. He is naturally honest, seeing no reason or value in lies. He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not under¬ stand why anyone would express negative attitudes. Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, ‘If 1 can do it you can’. Once, in a reading, I saw a very nice expression of what people used to call ‘the generation gap’: the King of Wands and the Fool, both of them energetic, yet one the essence of responsibility, the other the pure image of instinct and freedom. Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo. and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths. The closed circle means maturity and completion. Compare this image with the Knight's shirt, where the tails and mouths do not meet.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The adventurous Wands nature can make such a person uncomfortable in this role. He leans forward on his throne, as if he would like to leap up and go to seek new experience. He is naturally honest, seeing no reason or value in lies. He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not under¬ stand why anyone would express negative attitudes. Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, ‘If 1 can do it you can’. Once, in a reading, I saw a very nice expression of what people used to call ‘the generation gap’: the King of Wands and the Fool, both of them energetic, yet one the essence of responsibility, the other the pure image of instinct and freedom. Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo. and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths. The closed circle means maturity and completion. Compare this image with the Knight's shirt, where the tails and mouths do not meet.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

                "text": "winning, staying on top. While the fight goes on we enjoy it. People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

The adventurous Wands nature can make such a person uncomfortable in this role. He leans forward on his throne, as if he would like to leap up and go to seek new experience. He is naturally honest, seeing no reason or value in lies. He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not under¬ stand why anyone would express negative attitudes. Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, ‘If 1 can do it you can’. Once, in a reading, I saw a very nice expression of what people used to call ‘the generation gap’: the King of Wands and the Fool, both of them energetic, yet one the essence of responsibility, the other the pure image of instinct and freedom. Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo. and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths. The closed circle means maturity and completion. Compare this image with the Knight's shirt, where the tails and mouths do not meet.",

                "text": "The divinatory meanings of the Chariot derive from its powerful will. In a reading the card signifies that the person is successfully controlling some situation through the force of his or her personality. The card implies that a situation contains some contradictions and that these have not been brought together but simply held under control. This is not to stress too highly the negative undertones of the card. When it is the right way up the Chariot basically means success; the personality in charge of the world around it. If it appears as the outcome in a reading dealing with problems then it indicates victory-. Reversed, the card’s inherent contradictions gain greater force. The Chariot upside down implies that the approach of will-power has proven unsuccessful, and the situation has got out of control. Unless the person can find some other approach to the difficulties, he or she faces disaster. Will-power alone cannot always sustain us. Like Oedipus we must sometimes learn to give way to the gods. ith the second line of the Major Arcana we move from the outer world and its challenges to the inner self. The contradictions concealed in the Chariot’s powerful image must now be faced openly. The mask of ego must die.",

                "text": "While this book will deal extensively with the concepts embodied in the cards and their symbolism it will also look carefully at the application of these concepts to Tarot readings. Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience. Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental - forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way. Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.",

A great many mystics and shamans have said that their visions showed them how all things connect, how everything fits together, because the spirit unites the entire universe. Possibly we would all see and understand this grand scheme of life, if it were not for the fact that we do not live long enough. Our short lives narrow our vision to such a miniscule portion of the world that life appears meaningless. Now, this idea of the Wheel as the mystery of fate, with its hidden meaning, fits very well the modern Waite-Smith version of the card, especially when we consider it as halfway to the final trump. If we place the Rider pack Wheel beside the World we see immediately the link between them. In one we have a wheel filled with symbols; in the other we find a wreath of victory, and inside it a dancer who embodies the truth behind the symbols. Even more striking, we find the same four animals on each card in the corners, except that the mythological beings of card 10 have been transformed into something real and alive in the World. Thus, at the halfway point, we receive a vision of the inner meaning of life; at the end that vision has become real, embodied in our own being.",

The unconscious known consciously, the outer self unified with the forces of life, knowledge that is not knowledge at all but a constant ecstatic dance of being - they are all true and yet not true. We have already observed a great deal about this card and its images. The number as well as the two wands unify the Magician and the High Priestess. We saw the World foreshadowed as well in the Wheel of Fortune, and reflected how the symbols of that trump are now living realities. One way or another, the Wheel has come up for virtually every card in the last line. The purpose of this line can be described as that of uniting ourselves with all those things seen in trump 10 as external vision, that is, fate, the workings of life, the elements of existence. When the unity is achieved the symbols vanish, dissolved into a dancing spirit. We saw the World in the Hanged Man, by number and picture. Trump 12 maintained its bliss through complete inactivity. But even the World Tree is an illusion created by the mind’s need to grasp onto something. When we have dissolved our isolated selves into that water lying beneath the Hanged Man’s glowing face we learn that true unity lies in movement. Everything in the universe moves, the Earth around the sun, the sun within the galaxy, the galaxies in clusters, all cycling around each other. There is no centre, no place where we can say, ‘Here it all began, here it all stops.’ Yet the centre exists, everywhere, for in a dance the dancer does not move around any arbitrary point in space, but rather the dance carries its own sense of unity",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

No matter how absolute a quality may seem to us in the abstract, in reality it affects us only in the context of other influences. Readings demonstrate this fact in a practical way, as with the woman trying to deal with her lover’s jealousy. A card usually thought of as positive, the Sun, actually tended towards a bad result, for by hoping for the Sun she did not face the needs of the situation, and in fact allowed other people’s ideas to dictate what she wanted. Along with context we learn the ways in which the elements of life balance each other. We see first of all how the suits and specific cards combine to form a unified situation with no suit better or worse than any of the others. Astrologers often find that clients hope for certain signs and elements to dominate their charts, and will show disappointment or even shame if others appear. Similarly, for some people who know a little about Tarot, if a reading shows a lot of Wands, or Cups, they will feel comfor¬ ted; if it showed Swords they will become frightened; and if it shows Fentacles they will think of it as trivial, even insulting. Some will only accept a reading which contains many Major cards, because only the trumps, with their implications of power and spiritual awareness, appear important to them. But even the Major Arcana forms only one element, meaningless without the others. We study it in isolation for its wisdom and powerful description of existence. But in practice we need to mix the spiritual with the mundane, the happy with the sad, love and anger together to understand the world.",

We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

The answer is, any system will tell us something, but the quality of that something depends on the values contained in the system. The Tarot contains a philosophy, an outline of how human con¬ sciousness evolves, and a vast compendium of human experience. Shuffling the cards brings all these values into play with each other. We might argue that assigning a philosophy to the cards destroys their objectivity in terms of predicting events. Human values and interpretations have intruded in an otherwise.pure system. Such an idea, I think, would come from a misunder¬ standing of ‘objectivity’. The Tarot is objective because it bypasses conscious decision, but it is not impartial. On the contrary, it attempts to push us in certain directions: optimism, spirituality, a belief in the necessity and value of change. The meanings for the cards given in this book leave a good deal of room for interpretation by the reader. In fact, they require it. This is because the practised reader brings far more to her or his work than a detailed knowledge of the cards and their traditional meanings. Just as important is sensitivity - both to the pictures and to the person sitting there nervously and excitedly staring at the cards. A good reader does not simply repeat traditional fixed meanings. Rather, he or she will find new meanings and interpretations, will extend the patterns. While some people desire objective readings and dislike interpretation, others argue that a reader should not use any definite meanings at all, but always work from ‘feeling' the pictures at the moment. Yet to do so will limit the reader to the narrow range of his or her own perceptions. And those perceptions will always come at least partly from his or her",

Using the Tarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very tricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, usually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other systems. I have found it better to get a more general picture from the line, looking not just at physical condition but also emotional, spiritual health. One recommendation - observe which elements dominate. Strong Wands suggest good general health through the person’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie Nine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. Cups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual condition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker health or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for instance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of Major cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ ding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, would indicate good general health, Temperance would indicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- sickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can symbolize some special situation that has appeared or will appear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in the whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the beginning reader. The third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly the imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked at the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and awareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made conscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ tions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle level - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link between the two.",

Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

How do we combine the effects of our own decision with the influences of the outside world ? What do we mean when we say we take responsibility for our lives? Does it mean we create or control everything that happens to us? As in the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ sibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us entirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot readings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any moment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a very short person cannot expect to become a professional basketball player, so that same person must not consider his whole life dominated by height. People who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which counts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one really controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the meaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some readings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly dominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the determining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ ticular situation. Tarot readings help us develop confidence in our own perceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, and partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. Which of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case? Does a court card apply to the subject, some other person, or an abstract principle, such as the King of Swords signifying law and authority, or the Queen of Cups creativity?

More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it. Keep your eyes closed or opened, depending on what works for you; most people find that at least when the fantasy starts they prefer their eyes closed. Try to",

In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

The mind sees so many sides to a situation, so many possibilities, that understanding, let alone action, becomes impossible. Because our culture has always emphasized rationality, many people today see thinking in general as the cause of all life's problems. If we just stop thinking, they tell us, then everything will work out all right. Even if such a thing were possible, the Tarot tells us it would not benefit us. We do not overcome the problem of an element by banishing it or replacing it with something, but rather by combining it with other elements. The fact is, the more confused we are the more we need our minds, because nothing else can sort out the truth. We need also, however, to combine Air with Water - that is, emotion with receptivity. We need also to combine it with Ether, Spirit, the deep values grounded in spiritual/psychological truth that we see em¬ bodied in the Major Arcana. Then the problem of Air changes to the Way, wisdom. The more obvious problem shown in Swords is that of sorrow, pain, anger - the stormy side of Air. We cannot overcome these things by ignoring them, but we can add to Swords the optimism of Wands, and we can use Pentacles to take ourselves out of our emotions through an involvement with work, nature, the outside world.",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

The bull's head should be noted as a recurrent symbol on the throne. The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.

                "text": "If the situation is one that calls for such an easygoing approach then the Page’s unattached attitude is very bene¬ ficial. But if a more difficult problem is involved, then the Page's practice becomes hard to maintain. It requires ‘vigilance’ to use Waite’s term, making sure that people or situations do not get too close. Much of the Page’s energy goes to looking over his shoulder. As a somewhat aged student, Hamlet embodied the Page's attitude of observation and irony. His situation, however, called for the aggressive approach of the Knight. Because of his detached quality the Page can sometimes indulge himself in spying on people, either literally, or figuratively, as an attitude to life. In other words, he may look on human life as a kind of curious spectacle in which he himself does not expect to take part. Here we see the effect of the Page’s aloof attitude in a situation that requires more force. The vigilance turns to paranoia; everyone appears to be an enemy- What began as a feeling of ‘I’m above all that, I don’t need to concern myself with that,’ becomes an obsession with problems and a seeming inability to do anything about them. Such feelings of weakness art- endemic to Swords; they require Wands for courage and optimism. From the blue skies of the court cards to the black gloom of the Ten and Nine. Just as the Ten of Cups showed joy overflow¬ ing, so the Ten of Swords fills us with pain. Despite the extreme picture the card does not represent death, or even especially violence. It signifies more of a reaction to problems than the problems themselves.",

                "text": "In many cases, of course, the pictures are very simple and directly related to the meanings they were meant to illustrate. The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

But if a more difficult problem is involved, then the Page's practice becomes hard to maintain. It requires ‘vigilance’ to use Waite’s term, making sure that people or situations do not get too close. Much of the Page’s energy goes to looking over his shoulder. As a somewhat aged student, Hamlet embodied the Page's attitude of observation and irony. His situation, however, called for the aggressive approach of the Knight. Because of his detached quality the Page can sometimes indulge himself in spying on people, either literally, or figuratively, as an attitude to life. In other words, he may look on human life as a kind of curious spectacle in which he himself does not expect to take part. Here we see the effect of the Page’s aloof attitude in a situation that requires more force. The vigilance turns to paranoia; everyone appears to be an enemy- What began as a feeling of ‘I’m above all that, I don’t need to concern myself with that,’ becomes an obsession with problems and a seeming inability to do anything about them. Such feelings of weakness art- endemic to Swords; they require Wands for courage and optimism. From the blue skies of the court cards to the black gloom of the Ten and Nine. Just as the Ten of Cups showed joy overflow¬ ing, so the Ten of Swords fills us with pain. Despite the extreme picture the card does not represent death, or even especially violence. It signifies more of a reaction to problems than the problems themselves.",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

                "text": "Briefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

                "text": "The exaggerated fear goes back to the Six of Cups, and its overthrow. She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

What attitudes does the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect the situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a reading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position shows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the subject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship indicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile behaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome would indicate the result of the conflict. Just as the subject affects the reading so also do the people and general situations around him or her. We call the eighth card the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court card appears in this position it will usually mean a person influencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either the effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ tion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping or hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For instance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands reversed in the Environment would suggest that an atmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ tion is making work unpleasant. Sometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather than other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his surroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of Swords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of retreating from conflicts with the people around him.",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

                "text": "Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

What attitudes does the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect the situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a reading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position shows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the subject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship indicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile behaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome would indicate the result of the conflict. Just as the subject affects the reading so also do the people and general situations around him or her. We call the eighth card the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court card appears in this position it will usually mean a person influencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either the effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ tion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping or hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For instance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands reversed in the Environment would suggest that an atmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ tion is making work unpleasant. Sometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather than other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his surroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of Swords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of retreating from conflicts with the people around him.",

                "text": "The card bears a (distorted) relationship to all those Major cards (the Hierophant, the Lovers, the Devil, and others) in which some force holds together or reconciles the opposites of life. Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person. As a more objective source of informa¬ tion the Tarot can help",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of. seif-trust will often prove the most important. If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life. In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work. The Knight's responsibility for action brings",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite. Waite included a much lighter reading for the reversed Ace: ‘Clouded joy’. Then the Ace becomes",

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

                "text": "There are two basic variants here. First, all the emotion turns against itself. Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

                "text": "True optimism creates victory. False optimism, covering our doubts with bluster or illusion, leads to fear and weakness. The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal. Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action. The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side. The Five reversed brings to mind again that phrase 'the fire has gone out’. The number four, with its image of the square, implies stasis",

                "text": "Usually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea.

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duality of Hopes and Fears shows up most strongly in cards dealing with change, or the emergence from confined situations to open ones. Death, the Eight of Cups, the Two of Wands reversed, and the Four of Wands all deal with these themes of freedom and change. Some others are the Devil reversed, the Eight of Swords reversed, and the Star. Very often if the subject and the reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of these images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence will emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. Because the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or success), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains hidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this ambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or she really wants. Seeing this duality at work in one reading after another teaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning. The subconscious (the repressed material we might call the lower layer of the ego - again, see footnote on page 157) is basically",

                "text": "Usually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

Like the Ten of Cups it deals with domestic life, but where the men and women in Cups celebrate the gift, the family here does not notice the magic all around them. On the surface the card represents the established home, the good life, a secure and comfortable position in the world. The people concerned, however, appear to take the comfort for granted; they find the security boring or stifling. In contrast to the Ten of Cups (the two cards will often appear together in readings) the family here does not seem to communicate with each other. The man and woman face opposite ways, though the woman glances anxiously over her shoulder at the man. The child hangs on nervously to its mother, but looks away. And none of them notices the old man outside the arch. Though the card expresses mundaneness, magic signs cover it. The ten pentacles form the Qabalistic Tree of Life, some¬ thing which appears nowhere else in the deck. Notice also the magic wand resting against the arch; no other Minor card contains one. The arch itself bears a relief of balanced scales (just above the old man’s head). Now, scales stand for Justice, and further, for subtle forces which keep the everyday world from breaking into chaos. By ‘subtle forces’ I do not mean only so-called ‘occult’ laws, such as polarity, or the law of correspondences (as above, so below). The term applies also to nature’s generally more accepted workings, such as gravity, or electro-magnetism. Because we learn about these in school we should not consider such phenomena as any the less marvellous. The fact is, we all",

                "text": "In other situations, if the Page refers to psychic develop¬ ment, or true visions, then reversed shows a person disturbed by these visions. For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

Divinatory Meanings: Weariness, disgust, aversion, imaginary vexations, as if the wine of this world had caused satiety only; another wine, as if a fairy gift, is now offered the wastrel, but he sees no consolation therein. This is also a card of blended pleasure. Reversed: Novelty, presage, new instruction, new relations. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E.

                "text": "Above the Environment comes a position similar to Self but one with a sharper focus. We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

                "text": "There are two basic variants here. First, all the emotion turns against itself. Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

              "text": "We come now to the final and practical part of this division of our subject, being the way to consult and obtain oracles by means of Tarot cards. The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com Shuffle the entire pack and turn some of the cards round, so as to invert their tops. Let them be cut by the Querent with his left hand. Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner. In this method, the Querent--if of the male sex--is represented by the Magician, and if female by the High Priestess; but the card, in either case, is not taken from the pack until the forty-two cards have been laid out, as above directed.

However, if after interpreting this line, the reader and subject desire more information or simply another approach, the reader turns over a second line of seven directly below the first, and so on, until the meaning becomes clear. In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question.

The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or her. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ tunity. I have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In some readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with the others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms ’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- tions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as the Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of history, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian mystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through meditation on the cross and other methods of identification with Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the horizontal facts of their own physical existences. In many other cultures the image of a cross symbolizes the four horizontal directions along the surface of the earth, while the centre, the meeting place of the four, suggests the essentially vertical direction of the centre. The cross, therefore, also sym¬ bolizes the Tarot itself, the four arms being the four suits and the centre the Major Arcana.",

N.B.--If the Significator is a Trump or any small card that cannot be said to face either way, the Diviner must decide before beginning the operation which side he will take it as facing. Turn up the SIXTH CARD; place it on the side that the Significator is facing, and say: This is before him. It shews the influence that is coming into action and will operate in the near future.

              "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure.

As if in response to the troubles shown on the previous card the man has given himself a protective layer against any economic (or other) problems that might arise in the future. However, while the Five showed two people, here we see one person, excluding others through his need for personal security. As magic signs the pentacles symbolize basic emotional/ psychic energy. The man here uses his pentacles to close himself off from the outside world. He has covered his most vital points: the crown of the head (literally a crown here), the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet. People working with chakra meditation will recognize the first two as vital points of connection to Spirit, and to other people. Covering the feet symbolizes blocking ourselves off from the world around us. The man cannot, however, seal his back. We always remain vulnerable to life, no matter how self-centred we fry to make ourselves. In certain situations, the Four, usually viewed as a ‘problem' card, becomes very appropriate. When life has broken down into chaos, then the Four indicates creating a structure, either through material things, or by turning emotional and mental energy inwards. The card remains an image of selfishness but sometimes selfishness may be pre¬ cisely what is needed. People who meditate through their auras will usually, at the end of each meditation, follow a ritual of‘sealing' the aura at the chakra points. This practice prevents both a leaking of their own energy and a Hooding of the self by outside influences.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold.

People under Wands’ influence need to know they are alive, they need that charge of adrenalin to show them that the Fire still runs through them. Only later does the habit of constant battle close them in. As implied in the picture the person is using the excitement of conflict to rise above uncertainty and depression. Reversed indicates sinking into anxiety, indecision, embarrassment. Right side up he was not so much in control of his life as staying on top of it. Here he can no longer put off the con¬ tradictions. Above all, the card warns against indecision, suggesting that if a person can come to a clear course of action the natural Wands self-confidence will return to overcome the anxieties and outer problems. As the Wands progress down to the Ace they become stronger. The emphasis shifts from problems to joy, from defensiveness to optimism until, with the Ace, we become unified with the life-giving Fire. The Six marks a turning point. In the Golden Dawn system the card bears the title ‘Victory', and we see, in fact, a victory parade, the hero crowned with a wreath and surrounded by his followers. However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want. More, such belief will inspire others to follow us. Sixes deal with communication and gifts. Here it is the Fire belief in life that Wands give to the people around them.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element.

                "text": "to study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The adventurous Wands nature can make such a person uncomfortable in this role. He leans forward on his throne, as if he would like to leap up and go to seek new experience. He is naturally honest, seeing no reason or value in lies. He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not under¬ stand why anyone would express negative attitudes. Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, ‘If 1 can do it you can’. Once, in a reading, I saw a very nice expression of what people used to call ‘the generation gap’: the King of Wands and the Fool, both of them energetic, yet one the essence of responsibility, the other the pure image of instinct and freedom. Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo. and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths. The closed circle means maturity and completion. Compare this image with the Knight's shirt, where the tails and mouths do not meet.",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

                "text": "The divinatory meanings of the Chariot derive from its powerful will. In a reading the card signifies that the person is successfully controlling some situation through the force of his or her personality. The card implies that a situation contains some contradictions and that these have not been brought together but simply held under control. This is not to stress too highly the negative undertones of the card. When it is the right way up the Chariot basically means success; the personality in charge of the world around it. If it appears as the outcome in a reading dealing with problems then it indicates victory-. Reversed, the card’s inherent contradictions gain greater force. The Chariot upside down implies that the approach of will-power has proven unsuccessful, and the situation has got out of control. Unless the person can find some other approach to the difficulties, he or she faces disaster. Will-power alone cannot always sustain us. Like Oedipus we must sometimes learn to give way to the gods. ith the second line of the Major Arcana we move from the outer world and its challenges to the inner self. The contradictions concealed in the Chariot’s powerful image must now be faced openly. The mask of ego must die.",

                "text": "While this book will deal extensively with the concepts embodied in the cards and their symbolism it will also look carefully at the application of these concepts to Tarot readings. Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience. Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental - forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way. Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.",

A great many mystics and shamans have said that their visions showed them how all things connect, how everything fits together, because the spirit unites the entire universe. Possibly we would all see and understand this grand scheme of life, if it were not for the fact that we do not live long enough. Our short lives narrow our vision to such a miniscule portion of the world that life appears meaningless. Now, this idea of the Wheel as the mystery of fate, with its hidden meaning, fits very well the modern Waite-Smith version of the card, especially when we consider it as halfway to the final trump. If we place the Rider pack Wheel beside the World we see immediately the link between them. In one we have a wheel filled with symbols; in the other we find a wreath of victory, and inside it a dancer who embodies the truth behind the symbols. Even more striking, we find the same four animals on each card in the corners, except that the mythological beings of card 10 have been transformed into something real and alive in the World. Thus, at the halfway point, we receive a vision of the inner meaning of life; at the end that vision has become real, embodied in our own being.",

The unconscious known consciously, the outer self unified with the forces of life, knowledge that is not knowledge at all but a constant ecstatic dance of being - they are all true and yet not true. We have already observed a great deal about this card and its images. The number as well as the two wands unify the Magician and the High Priestess. We saw the World foreshadowed as well in the Wheel of Fortune, and reflected how the symbols of that trump are now living realities. One way or another, the Wheel has come up for virtually every card in the last line. The purpose of this line can be described as that of uniting ourselves with all those things seen in trump 10 as external vision, that is, fate, the workings of life, the elements of existence. When the unity is achieved the symbols vanish, dissolved into a dancing spirit. We saw the World in the Hanged Man, by number and picture. Trump 12 maintained its bliss through complete inactivity. But even the World Tree is an illusion created by the mind’s need to grasp onto something. When we have dissolved our isolated selves into that water lying beneath the Hanged Man’s glowing face we learn that true unity lies in movement. Everything in the universe moves, the Earth around the sun, the sun within the galaxy, the galaxies in clusters, all cycling around each other. There is no centre, no place where we can say, ‘Here it all began, here it all stops.’ Yet the centre exists, everywhere, for in a dance the dancer does not move around any arbitrary point in space, but rather the dance carries its own sense of unity",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

No matter how absolute a quality may seem to us in the abstract, in reality it affects us only in the context of other influences. Readings demonstrate this fact in a practical way, as with the woman trying to deal with her lover’s jealousy. A card usually thought of as positive, the Sun, actually tended towards a bad result, for by hoping for the Sun she did not face the needs of the situation, and in fact allowed other people’s ideas to dictate what she wanted. Along with context we learn the ways in which the elements of life balance each other. We see first of all how the suits and specific cards combine to form a unified situation with no suit better or worse than any of the others. Astrologers often find that clients hope for certain signs and elements to dominate their charts, and will show disappointment or even shame if others appear. Similarly, for some people who know a little about Tarot, if a reading shows a lot of Wands, or Cups, they will feel comfor¬ ted; if it showed Swords they will become frightened; and if it shows Fentacles they will think of it as trivial, even insulting. Some will only accept a reading which contains many Major cards, because only the trumps, with their implications of power and spiritual awareness, appear important to them. But even the Major Arcana forms only one element, meaningless without the others. We study it in isolation for its wisdom and powerful description of existence. But in practice we need to mix the spiritual with the mundane, the happy with the sad, love and anger together to understand the world.",

                "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

                "text": "If any device will provide meaning, why Tarot? The answer is, any system will tell us something, but the quality of that something depends on the values contained in the system. The Tarot contains a philosophy, an outline of how human con¬ sciousness evolves, and a vast compendium of human experience. Shuffling the cards brings all these values into play with each other. We might argue that assigning a philosophy to the cards destroys their objectivity in terms of predicting events. Human values and interpretations have intruded in an otherwise.pure system. Such an idea, I think, would come from a misunder¬ standing of ‘objectivity’. The Tarot is objective because it bypasses conscious decision, but it is not impartial. On the contrary, it attempts to push us in certain directions: optimism, spirituality, a belief in the necessity and value of change. The meanings for the cards given in this book leave a good deal of room for interpretation by the reader. In fact, they require it. This is because the practised reader brings far more to her or his work than a detailed knowledge of the cards and their traditional meanings. Just as important is sensitivity - both to the pictures and to the person sitting there nervously and excitedly staring at the cards. A good reader does not simply repeat traditional fixed meanings. Rather, he or she will find new meanings and interpretations, will extend the patterns. While some people desire objective readings and dislike interpretation, others argue that a reader should not use any definite meanings at all, but always work from ‘feeling' the pictures at the moment. Yet to do so will limit the reader to the narrow range of his or her own perceptions. And those perceptions will always come at least partly from his or her",

Using the Tarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very tricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, usually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other systems. I have found it better to get a more general picture from the line, looking not just at physical condition but also emotional, spiritual health. One recommendation - observe which elements dominate. Strong Wands suggest good general health through the person’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie Nine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. Cups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual condition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker health or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for instance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of Major cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ ding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, would indicate good general health, Temperance would indicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- sickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can symbolize some special situation that has appeared or will appear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in the whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the beginning reader. The third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly the imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked at the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and awareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made conscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ tions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle level - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link between the two.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

Does it mean we create or control everything that happens to us? As in the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ sibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us entirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot readings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any moment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a very short person cannot expect to become a professional basketball player, so that same person must not consider his whole life dominated by height. People who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which counts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one really controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the meaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some readings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly dominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the determining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ ticular situation. Tarot readings help us develop confidence in our own perceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, and partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. Which of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case?

More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over. And this awareness indicates that the three fallen cups symbolize something less important than might at first seem at the time of its destruc¬ tion. The passiveness of Cups can sometimes lead to apathy. What we can call the ‘negative imagination' makes us look at every¬ thing as worthless or boring. There seems to be nothing worth getting up for, nothing worth doing, and nothing worth examining. The three cups symbolize the person’s past experience. Bored by what life has given him he does not recognize the new opportunities being offered to him by the fourth cup. The resemblance of that cup to the Ace suggests that the new possibilities can lead to happiness and satisfaction. In the main, however, the card shows a situation when everything in life has come to appear the same. The card sometimes shows apathy resulting from a dull, unstimulating environment. Again, the reversal takes us out of ourselves and awakens us to the world and its possibilities. New things are offered, new relations, new ideas. Most important, the reversed card shows enthusiasm and the seizing of opportunities.",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

It is an intimation of that which may lie behind the Lesser Arcana. Divinatory Meanings: House of the true heart, joy, content, abode, nourishment, abundance, fertility; Holy Table, felicity hereof.

                "text": "One of the most symbolic and deeply-layered Minor cards, the Ten shows us the very image of the Gate opening to hidden experience in ordinary things. Like the Ten of Cups it deals with domestic life, but where the men and women in Cups celebrate the gift, the family here does not notice the magic all around them. On the surface the card represents the established home, the good life, a secure and comfortable position in the world. The people concerned, however, appear to take the comfort for granted; they find the security boring or stifling. In contrast to the Ten of Cups (the two cards will often appear together in readings) the family here does not seem to communicate with each other. The man and woman face opposite ways, though the woman glances anxiously over her shoulder at the man. The child hangs on nervously to its mother, but looks away. And none of them notices the old man outside the arch. Though the card expresses mundaneness, magic signs cover it. The ten pentacles form the Qabalistic Tree of Life, some¬ thing which appears nowhere else in the deck. Notice also the magic wand resting against the arch; no other Minor card contains one. The arch itself bears a relief of balanced scales (just above the old man’s head). Now, scales stand for Justice, and further, for subtle forces which keep the everyday world from breaking into chaos. By ‘subtle forces’ I do not mean only so-called ‘occult’ laws, such as polarity, or the law of correspondences (as above, so below). The term applies also to nature’s generally more accepted workings, such as gravity, or electro-magnetism. Because we learn about these in school we should not consider such phenomena as any the less marvellous. The fact is, we all",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

                "text": "The very mundaneness of day-to-day life ensures, by a kind of law of reciprocity, that such things possess a greater ‘magic’ than the more immediate attractions of the other elements. We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

                "text": "Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

                "text": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else.

What attitudes does the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect the situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a reading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position shows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the subject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship indicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile behaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome would indicate the result of the conflict. Just as the subject affects the reading so also do the people and general situations around him or her. We call the eighth card the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court card appears in this position it will usually mean a person influencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either the effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ tion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping or hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For instance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands reversed in the Environment would suggest that an atmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ tion is making work unpleasant. Sometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather than other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his surroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of Swords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of retreating from conflicts with the people around him.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of. seif-trust will often prove the most important. If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life. In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work. The Knight's responsibility for action brings",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of",

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal. Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action. The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side.

Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duality of Hopes and Fears shows up most strongly in cards dealing with change, or the emergence from confined situations to open ones. Death, the Eight of Cups, the Two of Wands reversed, and the Four of Wands all deal with these themes of freedom and change. Some others are the Devil reversed, the Eight of Swords reversed, and the Star. Very often if the subject and the reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of these images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence will emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. Because the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or success), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains hidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this ambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or she really wants. Seeing this duality at work in one reading after another teaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning.

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else.

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

                "text": "To the right stand a monk and an architect holding the plans of the church. Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides.

The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

                "text": "Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

                "text": "In many cases, of course, the pictures are very simple and directly related to the meanings they were meant to illustrate. The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

The mind sees so many sides to a situation, so many possibilities, that understanding, let alone action, becomes impossible. Because our culture has always emphasized rationality, many people today see thinking in general as the cause of all life's problems. If we just stop thinking, they tell us, then everything will work out all right. Even if such a thing were possible, the Tarot tells us it would not benefit us. We do not overcome the problem of an element by banishing it or replacing it with something, but rather by combining it with other elements. The fact is, the more confused we are the more we need our minds, because nothing else can sort out the truth. We need also, however, to combine Air with Water - that is, emotion with receptivity. We need also to combine it with Ether, Spirit, the deep values grounded in spiritual/psychological truth that we see em¬ bodied in the Major Arcana. Then the problem of Air changes to the Way, wisdom. The more obvious problem shown in Swords is that of sorrow, pain, anger - the stormy side of Air. We cannot overcome these things by ignoring them, but we can add to Swords the optimism of Wands, and we can use Pentacles to take ourselves out of our emotions through an involvement with work, nature, the outside world.",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

But if a more difficult problem is involved, then the Page's practice becomes hard to maintain. It requires ‘vigilance’ to use Waite’s term, making sure that people or situations do not get too close. Much of the Page’s energy goes to looking over his shoulder. As a somewhat aged student, Hamlet embodied the Page's attitude of observation and irony. His situation, however, called for the aggressive approach of the Knight. Because of his detached quality the Page can sometimes indulge himself in spying on people, either literally, or figuratively, as an attitude to life. In other words, he may look on human life as a kind of curious spectacle in which he himself does not expect to take part. Here we see the effect of the Page’s aloof attitude in a situation that requires more force. The vigilance turns to paranoia; everyone appears to be an enemy- What began as a feeling of ‘I’m above all that, I don’t need to concern myself with that,’ becomes an obsession with problems and a seeming inability to do anything about them. Such feelings of weakness art- endemic to Swords; they require Wands for courage and optimism. From the blue skies of the court cards to the black gloom of the Ten and Nine. Just as the Ten of Cups showed joy overflow¬ ing, so the Ten of Swords fills us with pain. Despite the extreme picture the card does not represent death, or even especially violence. It signifies more of a reaction to problems than the problems themselves.",

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind.

One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

What attitudes does the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect the situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a reading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position shows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the subject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship indicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile behaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome would indicate the result of the conflict. Just as the subject affects the reading so also do the people and general situations around him or her. We call the eighth card the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court card appears in this position it will usually mean a person influencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either the effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ tion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping or hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For instance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands reversed in the Environment would suggest that an atmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ tion is making work unpleasant. Sometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather than other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his surroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of Swords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of retreating from conflicts with the people around him.",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold.

On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct. The grip fails, bringing illusion, confused ideas and feelings, overpowering emotions. The more violent feelings overcome the benevolent ones. Without a clear sense of reality, the mind can fall prey to mistakes created by emotion. Problems become exaggerated; everything, including attractions, appears to be more important than it actually is. In such situations, the Ace of Swords reversed tells us to take hold of ourselves and try to find a balanced sense of reality. Our culture has a long history of despising the physical world. We see Adam’s creation out of clay as a humiliation - ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust’. We insult people by ‘treating them like dirt’. Emotions and abstract thoughts are seen as ‘higher' than anything w'hich actually exists. And yet, just as a painting is the end result of an artist 's conception, so we can see the mortal world as the product of God’s creative force. For us, creation means the world of our senses. However far we may travel in spiritual meditations we must begin and return here - or lose ourselves in the process. A famous Qabalistic tale illustrates this need for ‘groun¬ ding’.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

                "text": "As the yin aspect of the suit, the Queen of Swords symbolizes experiences of both sorrow and wisdom, and especially the connection between them. Having experienced pain (the card sometimes signifies widowhood), and having faced it with courage, acceptance, and honesty, she has found wisdom. The tassel hanging from her left wrist (the side of experience) resembles a cut rope (compare the Eight of Swords, p.82). She has used the sword of her intellect to free herself from confusion, doubt, and fear; now, although she frowns at the world, she opens her hand to it. Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her. Her sword, like that of Justice and the Ace, stands straight up. In the sense that powerless women will often suffer from the actions of men, the card refers specifically to women. In its character, it can represent someone of either sex, for neither sorrow nor courage are restricted by gender. The reversed Queen can indicate an overemphasis on sorrow, someone who makes life seem much worse than it is by ignoring the good things around her. She can also show a strong mind turned nasty, especially as a reaction to pain or pressure from unpleasant situations or people. Sometimes she represents a person so forceful she or he expects, not just demands, that everyone around her, even life itself, will do what she wants. When people oppose her, the Queen turns malicious, narrow minded, bigoted, and like the King, uses her attitudes to force her personality on the people around her. Whether she represents an excess of sorrow or egoism, she has lost the right side up commitment to truth.",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

                "text": "Now, the cover card usually stands for some basic influence on the subject, a general situation or starting point for the reading. The second card, which we always read right side up, despite how it comes off the deck, represents in traditional systems an ‘opposing influence’, something counter to the first. In practice, this ‘opposition’ may actually form a second influence supporting the first. For example, suppose the cover card was the Fool, indicat¬ ing a sense of following instincts despite what may seem the more sensible practice. If Temperance crossed it, we could call it an opposition, since Temperance usually refers to caution. But if the Knight of Wands crossed the Fool, the two cards would tend to support each other, and in fact the other cards might suggest a need for a more temperate influence to balance all that eagerness. In my work I have developed a slightly different way of looking at the first two cards, referring to them not as cover and ‘opposition’ but as ‘Centre’ and ‘crossing’. For their meanings I term them the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ aspects, or some¬ times ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ time, or simply ‘being’ and ‘doing’. The Centre card shows some basic quality of the person or the person’s situation. I'he crossing card then shows how that quality affects the person, or how it translates into action. Put another way, the first shows what the person is, the second how he or she acts. Consider the example in Fig. 57. The Fool would indicate a person with an inner tendency to take chances, to follow instinct. Temperance crossing it would mean that when it comes to action the person tends towards a more careful approach, blending instinctive energy with more practical considerations.",

Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help. Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, one's true plans or intentions. The isolation turns around to become communication, in par¬ ticular seeking advice on what to do about one's problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the act of finding help, such as consult¬ ing a reader or a therapist or simply friends. Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to deter¬ mine which course - independence or seeking advice — will produce the best results. A strange and powerful image, this card more than any other illustrates how Pamela Smith’s images reach beyond Arthur Waite's formulas. The Pictorial Key says ‘journey by water, route, way, expedient'. But the picture of",

The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards ...\n\n[2] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.70)\nDrawing on another well-known symbolic system Wands and Swords represent ‘yang' or ‘active' situations, while Cups and Pentacles stand for ‘yin - or ‘passive' ones. We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either ma...\n\n[3] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.70)\nThere are two basic variants here. First, all the emotion turns against itself. Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wan...\n\n[4] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.69)\nto study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than polit...\n\n[5] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.69)\nIn astrology and Jungian thought the elements stand for types and characteristics. In the Tarot we see these types reflected in the court cards. The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or...\n\n[6] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.68)\nA young man, leaning on his staff, looks intently at seven pentacles attached to a clump of greenery on his right; one would say that these were his treasures and that his heart was there. Divinatory Meanings: These are exceedingly contradictory; in the main, it is a card of money, business, barter; but one reading gives altercation, quarrels--and another innocence, ingenuity, purgation. Reversed: Cause for anxiety regarding money which it may be proposed to lend.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with he...\n\n[8] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.67)\nFool to the place which is usually occupied by the Ace of Pentacles as the last of the whole Tarot series. This rearrangement has been followed by Papus recently in Le Tarot Divinatoire, where the confusion is of no consequence, as the findings of fortune telling depend upon fortuitous positions and not upon essential place in the general sequence of cards.

While this is often the case, they can also symbolize the subject him or herself. Taken by themselves, that is, outside the context of specific readings, the sixteen court cards provide a greater range of human character. Either in a reading or by itself as an object of study any specific court card indicates a person having or expressing those qualities signified by that card.

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck.

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than ...\n\n[15] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nThis line forms the basic cycle, and the reading may stop with these nine cards. However, if after interpreting this line, the reader and subject desire more information or simply another approach, the reader turns over a second line of seven directly below the first, and so on, until the meaning becomes clear. In each line the first two cards for the starting point.

The card always signifies honesty, an...\n\n[17] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nFinally, the Outcome. This card brings together all the others. More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome app...\n\n[18] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nFire implies swiftness and movement. Though this movement sometimes lacks direction we see here the image of a journey reaching an end, or things completed. When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, ...\n\n[19] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nthe ones I use. I'hey follow the traditional system, with certain changes. In every way of laying out the Celtic Cross the first two cards form a small cross of their own with the first one, the ‘cover' card, lying directly on top of the Significator and the second lying horizontally across it.\n\n[20] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nAnother example will help illustrate this most valuable part of a Celtic Cross reading. The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the p...\n\n[21] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\ned. These things emerge through interpretation of the Tarot's images, through joining ourselves to those images in medita¬ tion, and through seeing the combinations formed in readings. Taken separately, the cards of the Minor Arcana present us with a grand panorama of human experiences. Together, and in union with the archetypal Major cards, they draw us into ever wider knowledge of the changing wonder of life.\n\n[22] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nIn the Tarot we see the four elements as Fire-Wands (Staves), Water-Cups, Air-Swords, Earth-Pentacles (Coins). Different writers sometimes give variations on this listing, most often switching Wands and Fentacles, on the grounds that sticks grow out of the earth, and coins are forged in a fire. I have chosen to stay with the more common listing because of the wider associations of fire and earth. Fire is not simply a human tool, but a great force in nature, seen most powerfully in the sun which ...\n\n[23] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nFor many people, meaningful work is simply not available. In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well.

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles ...\n\n[27] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nhuman psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person. As a more objective source of informa¬ tion the Tarot can help us understand our own or someone else’s needs. Because of these meanings, the Six of Pentacles relates to the Nine in the context of that card as an emblem of certitude.\n\n[28] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nGate card. They are powerful images, with an effect all their own. The act of looking at the Nine of Pentacles, letting it sink into you, helps to create discipline, just as carrying and looking at the Six of Pentacles or the High Priestess will help you focus your awareness in a receptive way.\n\n[29] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nThe four Court Cards in Wands represent very fair people, with yellow or auburn hair, fair complexion and blue eyes. The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions.

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concern...\n\n[32] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nBut if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal term...\n\n[33] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nFinally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meetin...\n\n[34] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nThe basic meaning of the card can change in three ways when reversed. First, it can mean not accepting the loss, and as an extension of this, false projects or mistakes. Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and per¬ manent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of...\n\n[35] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nNotice in this last example that the Two of Cups reversed might be a fear, but it might also be a hope. We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duali...\n\n[36] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nsuit of Wands, with its emphasis on action, contains fewer of these inner cards than any of the other suits). Metaphysically the sea has always evoked in people a sense of the vast ness and mystery of the universe, while rivers symbolize the experience of the ego dissolving into that great Sea.

This schem...\n\n[37] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.64)\nAt the same time he shows the Wands energy controlled and turned into useful projects, or long-term careers.

He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not under¬ stand why anyone would express negative a...\n\n[38] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.64)\nthe Kings represent both success (for the king, after all, is supreme) and social responsibility. The King of Wands translates these qualities into Wands terms. He indicates a strong-minded person, able to dominate others by strength of will. His power derives from a firm belief in his own rightness. He knows the truth; he knows his method is best. He considers it only natural for others to follow him.\n\n[39] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.64)\nBriefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the ...\n\n[40] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.64)\nWe next placed cards in the four corners around the structure, beginning with the Six of Swords and the Eight of Wands in the bottom left and right. The cards showed the journey and its hoped for end. For the top corners we used the Eight of Swords reversed and the King of Wands reversed - the desired action and the attitude needed to produce it. Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords.

Please deeply integrate the [Core Intuitive Imagery] as a central thread running through the entire reading. Analyze how this imagery resonates with the symbolic meaning of each card and use it to connect the relationships between the cards.\n\n**Step 3: Narrative Construction (Narrative Construction)**\nNow, weave all the information into a smooth, logical story. Please unfold the narrative according to the spread's sequence (e.g., Past-Present-Future), explaining how one card develops into the next to reveal the underlying causal logic.\n\n**Step 4: Distill Key Insights (Key Insights)**\nBased on the narrative, clearly summarize 1-3 of the most critical key insights or fundamental issues revealed by this reading regarding the question asked.\n\n**Step 5: Provide Constructive Actionable Guidance (Actionable Guidance)**\nFinally, based on all the analysis above, provide specific, positive, and actionable advice.\n- **Positive Guidance**: Even if the cards show challenges, find the lessons for growth and the potential for transformation.\n- **Specific Recommendations**: Based on the energy analysis from Step 1 (e.g., missing elements) and the key insights from Step 4, offer 1-2 concrete action steps.\n- **Emphasize Personal Power**: Conclude by reiterating that the cards reveal current energy trends and possibilities, but the querent holds the ultimate power of choice to shape their future.\n\n# Important Notes\n- **Critical Thinking**: The [RAG Retrieved Information] may contain repetitive, contradictory, or not entirely accurate content. Please act as an expert, critically screening, integrating, and refining the information to form a logically coherent and insightful interpretation.\n- **Output Language**: Please generate your complete interpretation in **Simplified Chinese**, using Markdown format for the best readability.\n- **Accessibility and Clarity**: This interpretation will be read by people who may have little or no knowledge of Tarot divination. Please minimize the use of technical jargon and specialized terminology. When you must use Tarot-specific terms (such as \"Major Arcana\", \"reversed\", \"suit\", etc.), provide clear explanations or context so that non-experts can understand. Offer detailed and comprehensive explanations throughout your interpretation, ensuring that every concept, symbol, and insight is thoroughly explained in accessible language. Your goal is to make the reading meaningful and understandable to someone encountering Tarot for the first time.",
