You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain.

In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question.

              "text": "Another example will help illustrate this most valuable part of a Celtic Cross reading. The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or her. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ tunity. I have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In some readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with the others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms ’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- tions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as the Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of history, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian mystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through meditation on the cross and other methods of identification with Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the horizontal facts of their own physical existences. In many other cultures the image of a cross symbolizes the four horizontal directions along the surface of the earth, while the centre, the meeting place of the four, suggests the essentially vertical direction of the centre. The cross, therefore, also sym¬ bolizes the Tarot itself, the four arms being the four suits and the centre the Major Arcana.",

              "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

But it connects as well to Cups, with their emphasis on imagination and instinct. The Fool, in fact, combines these two suits. Later we will see that this combination, fire and water, represents the way of transformation. Finally the question arises of the Fool’s place in divinatory readings. I have already mentioned the importance of readings for a fuller understanding of the cards. Even more, they help us apply the wisdom of the cards to our daily lives. In readings the Fool speaks to us of courage and optimism, urging faith in ourselves and in life. At difficult times, when we come under pressure from people around us to be practical, the Fool reminds us that our own inner selves can best tell us what to do. The Fool can often symbolize beginnings, courageously leaping off into some new phase of life, particularly when that leap is taken from some deep feeling rather than careful planning. These belong to the Fool in its normal position. We must also consider the ‘reversed’ meanings, that is, when the way we have mixed the cards makes the Fool come out with the feet on the top. Reversed meanings are controversial among Tarot commentators. Those who give formulas as meanings usually just turn the formula around, a simplistic method which has led several interpreters to abandon the whole idea of reversed meanings. But we can also look at reversals as deepening the meaning of the card as a whole. In general, a reversed card indicates that the qualities of that card have become blocked, distorted or channelled in another direction. For the Fool a reversal means",

And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing. This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to the Fool - the awareness that great chances must be taken only at the proper time. There are, after all, many times when caution is needed, and times when it is better to do nothing at all. The basic thing any oracle teaches us is that no action or attitude is right or wrong, except in its proper context. As wc go further into the Tarot we will see that this concept of the proper time permeates the cards and is, in fact, the true key to their correct use. The card in the Rider pack that falls exactly in the middle of the three lines, that is, Justice, means a proper response. The Magician emerges very directly from the Fool in the image of the trickster-wizard. As mentioned above, Merlin fulfils both these roles (as well as that of teacher and wise man), and many other myths make the same connection. Earlier Tarot decks pictured trump number one as a conjurer rather than a magus, or even a juggler tossing coloured balls in the air. Charles Williams described him as a juggler tossing the stars and planets.",

The compiler of the Manual of Cartomancy has treated them under three headings: the World of Human Prudence, which does not differ from divination on its more serious side; the World of Conformity, being the life of religious devotion; and the World of Attainment, which is that of \"the soul's progress towards the term of its research.\" He gives also a triple process of consultation, according to these divisions, to which the reader is referred. I have no such process to offer, as I think that more may be gained by individual reflection on each of the Trumps Major. I have also not adopted the prevailing attribution of the cards to the Hebrew alphabet--firstly, because it would serve no purpose in an elementary handbook; secondly, because nearly every attribution is wrong. Finally, I have not attempted to rectify the position of the cards in their relation to one another; the Zero therefore appears after No. 20, but I have taken care not to number the World or Universe otherwise than as 21. Wherever it ought to be put, the Zero is an unnumbered card. In conclusion as to this part, I will give these further indications regarding the Fool, which is the most speaking of all the symbols.

Haich describes the Fool’s face as a mask, put there not by himself but by the outside world. The last card, the World, presents the same enlightened person, but viewed from inside, that is, by himself. In some early Tarot decks the Fool appeared as a giant court jester, towering over the people around him. His title was ‘the Fool of God’. The term has also been used for idiots, harmless madmen, and severe epileptics, all of whom were thought to be in touch with a greater wisdom precisely because they were out of touch with the rest of us. The archetype persists in modern popular mythology as well. By their fantastic primitive nature comic books often reflect mythological themes better than novels. In Batman the hero’s strongest enemy is called the Joker, a figure who has no past and is never seen without the wild make-up of a joker in a deck of cards. The joker, of course, descends directly from the Fool of tarochhi. The rivalry of Batman and the Joker sends a clear message to their readers: do not rebel against social values. Support law and order. In recent years the magazine has described the Joker as insane rather than criminal. To society the way of the Fool, instinct rather than rules, is a dangerous insanity. So far we have looked at the Fool as the ‘other’, prodding us from complacency with his jokes and disguises.

Perhaps such a radiant self never really existed. Somehow we experience our intuition of it as something lost. Virtually every culture has developed a myth of a Fall from a primeval paradise. ‘Innocence’ is a word often misunderstood. It does not mean without guilt’ but rather a freedom and a total openness to life, a complete lack of fear that comes through a total faith in living and in your own instinctive self. Innocence does not mean ‘asexual’ as some people think. It is sexuality expressed without fear, without guilt, without connivance and dishonesty. It is sexuality expressed spontaneously and freely, as the expression of love and the ecstasy of life. The Fool bears the number 0 because all things are possible to the person who is always ready to go in any direction. He does not belong in any specific place; he is not fixed like the other cards. His innocence makes him a person with no past, and therefore an infinite future. Every moment is a new starting point. In Arabic numerals the number 0 bears the shape of an egg, to indicate that all things emerge from it. Originally the zero was written as a dot; in Hermetic and Qabalistic tradition the universe emerged from a single point of light. And God in the Qabalah is often described as ‘nothingness’ because to describe God as any thing would be to limit Him to some finite fixed state.

If we see the Fool as the beginning of the Major Arcana, the King of Pentacles as the final card of the Minor, then the two stand at opposite ends of the Tarot. But this polarity holds true only if we see the cards in a line. If we envision them in a circle, then the Fool and the King of Pentacles become joined together. The King is meant for success. Reversing him suggests failure or simply mediocrity. The lack of fulfilment brings dissatisfac¬ tion, feelings of weakness, and doubt. Taken another way we can see the upside down King as symbolizing the idea of success corrupted, the image of a man or a woman who will use any means to achieve his or her goals. If we describe the King of Pentacles as someone who needs a vital connection with nature (and not everyone does, despite contemporary assumptions), the King reversed stands for the state of being cut off from that rejuvenating Row. Here too the break results in dissatisfaction, weakness, even psychic danger. Where the King sits before a castle the Queen's throne stands entirely in a field, framed by roses.

A world of magicians, of people hanging upside down, and of dancers in the bright air. You can enter through a leap from a height, through a dark cave, a labyrinth, or even by climbing down a rabbit hole chasing a Victorian rabbit with a pocket watch. Whichever way you choose, you are a fool to do it. Why look into the deep world of the mind when you can stay safely in the ordinary landscape of job, home and family? Herman Melville, in Moby Dick , warned his readers not to take even a step outside the ordinary path laid out for you by society. You might not get back again. And yet, for those willing to take the chance, the leap can bring joy, adventure, and finally, for those with the courage to keep going when the wonderland becomes more fearsome than joyous, the leap can bring knowledge, peace, and liberation. Interestingly, the Fool archetype appears more in mythology than in structured religion. An institutionalized Church can hardly urge people beyond the limits of institutions. Instead, the churches offer us a safe haven from the fears of life. Mythology leads directly into the heart of those fears, and in every culture the mythological landscape contains the image of the Trickster - pushing, goading, jabbing the kings and heroes whenever they turn away from the inner world of truth.",

The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept.

Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

                "text": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

The situation is not so bad as it looks. '['urn this card round and we can imagine the swords failing out of his back. Waite describes it as success and advantage, but not permanent. These ideas suggest that when a situation changes, the problems may go away for the moment. However, the person must now take advantage of this relief by making a real change in her or his condition - either practical or mental, depending on the need — so that the situation will not revert to what it w-as. The card bears a relationship to the Ten of Wands reversed, where we saw the danger of picking up the sticks again once the situation has calmed down. The image of deepest sorrow, of utmost mental pain. Where the Queen frees herself by turning sorrow into wisdom, and the Three suggests the calm of acceptance, the Nine shows the moment of agony, of dissolution. The Swords do not stick in her back, but hang in the black air above her. Very often the Nine refers not to something happening directly to us, but rather to someone we love. Love, in fact, fills the card and gives it its meaning. The blanket design shows roses, symbol of passion, alternating with the signs of the zodiac. In the card’s deepest sense it shows",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "Fire implies swiftness and movement. Though this movement sometimes lacks direction we see here the image of a journey reaching an end, or things completed. When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of",

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite. Waite included a much lighter reading for the reversed Ace: ‘Clouded joy’. Then the Ace becomes",

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal. Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action. The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side. The Five reversed brings to mind again that phrase 'the fire has gone out’. The number four, with its image of the square, implies stasis",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana.

In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection.

Very often if the subject and the reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of these images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence will emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. Because the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or success), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains hidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this ambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or she really wants. Seeing this duality at work in one reading after another teaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning. The subconscious (the repressed material we might call the lower layer of the ego - again, see footnote on page 157) is basically",

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold.

                "text": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

It is worth repeating here the original example which suggested the symbolism of crossed time. The reading was done for a man unsure of the direction of his life. A long love affair was ending, his chosen career as a professional singer had not materialized. The reading began with the High Priestess crossed by the Hiero¬ phant. Now these cards, sometimes called the Papess and the Pope, at first glance represent contradictory values. The High Priestess stands for instinct, mystery, stillness, while the Hierophant, as the preacher of a doctrine by which people may guide their lives, stands for orthodoxy, planned behaviour, clarity. Therefore, it appeared that the two sym¬ bolized conflicting approaches to life. The more I looked at them, however, with their religious imagery, the more I thought of conjunctions, rather than opposites. The two seemed to prescribe almost a way of dealing with life. The High Priestess indicated that within himself this man carried qualities of instinct and understanding that might never fully emerge but could give his life substance. The Hierophant, on the other hand, showed that in his daily life he needed a more rational plan of action; he needed to organize and make definite decisions to achieve what he wanted. But these plans and practical steps would work best if backed by his own instincts and inner awareness rather than by socially- acceptable ideas of proper goals and behaviour. Just as I was trying to explain how these qualities could complement each other the man broke in to say how he saw them as constantly",

Now, Aries symbolizes force, aggression and war, but as the first sign of the zodiac it also signifies the new life of spring, which can emerge from the stability of a just society. As the middle card of the first line of the Major Arcana the Emperor represents a crucial test. In the process of growing up it is indeed the rules of society that many people find most difficult to surmount. We must absorb these rules, as well as our society’s traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude ‘rules are made to be broken’. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly. Because of the father’s role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mother’s, rather than their own, passions and sensuality.

I have seen readings so dominated by the Emperor that all of life’s possibilities become stunted and unfulfilled. Like the Empress reversed, the Emperor, when upside down, receives those elements complementary to his qualities when he is the right way up. He is, in Waite’s terms, ‘benevolence and compassion’; new life in a stony desert. But the pendulum can swing too far. The reversed Emperor can signify immaturity, and the inability to make harsh decisions and carry them through.",

But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world ‘married’ to nature. He symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them. In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddess’s representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. We see this drama (much like Freud’s substitution of super-ego for id) in many myths; such as Marduk, national hero of Babylon, killing Tiamat, the original mother of creation, because she is giving birth to monsters. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature. In Rome, the concept of law versus chaos was carried to the point where stability, or ‘law and order’ to use the modern term, became virtues in themselves, apart from the inherent morality of those laws. No progress can be made in conditions of anarchy (runs the argument); bad laws need to be changed, but first the law must be obeyed at all costs. Any other approach can only destroy society. Today, we see this viewpoint embodied in an abstraction we call the ‘system’. The Romans saw it more concretely in the personal figure of the Emperor,",

The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience. Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental - forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way. Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.",

The picture on the right at the start of this section, from Paul Foster Case’s Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) deck drawn by Jessie Burns Parke, illustrates another tradition. Here the Emperor symbolizes the sum total of spiritual knowledge. He is drawn in profile (this is much more common than the Rider pack full face image), linking them to the Qabalist image for God as the ‘Ancient of Days’, a seated king in profile. (The Ancient’s face was never visible, only his crown with a radiance beneath.) The Emperor’s arms and legs form an equilateral triangle over a cross, the alchemical sign for fire. This figure is later reversed (in Waite as well as Case) in the Hanged Man. As mentioned above, the crossed legs are an esoteric sign, found also on the card of the World. The BOTA Emperor sits on a cube rather than a throne. Also an esoteric symbol, the cube symbolizes both the world and the Tarot itself, as well as the Hebrew alphabet and the paths of the Tree of Life. The symbolism arises from the fact that a cube contains twelve edges, six faces, three axes, and of course a centre, adding up to twenty-two, the number of trumps, Hebrew letters, and paths. And because the Tree of Life is held to represent all creation the cube symbolizes the universe. In readings the Emperor indicates (following the Rider pack image) the power of society, its laws and especially its authority to enforce those laws. The appearance of the trump indicates an encounter with the law. Again, the good or bad qualities depend on the context.",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

This is the colportage interpretation, and it has the same correspondence with the real symbolical meaning that the use of the Tarot in fortune-telling has with its mystic construction according to the secret science of symbolism. I should add that many independent students of the subject, following their own lights, have produced individual sequences of meaning in respect of the Trumps Major, and their lights are sometimes suggestive, but they are not the true lights. For example, Eliphas Levi says that the Magus signifies that unity which is the mother of numbers; others say that it is the Divine Unity; and one of the latest French commentators considers that in its general sense it is the will. 2. The High Priestess, the Pope Joan, or Female Pontiff; early expositors have sought to term this card the Mother, or Pope's Wife, which is opposed to the symbolism. It is sometimes held to represent the Divine Law and the Gnosis, in which case the Priestess corresponds to the idea of the Shekinah. She is the Secret Tradition and the higher sense of the instituted Mysteries. 3. The Empress, who is sometimes represented with full face, while her correspondence, the Emperor, is in profile. As there has been some tendency to ascribe a symbolical significance to this distinction, it seems desirable to say that it carries no inner meaning. The Empress has been connected with the ideas of universal fecundity and in a general sense with activity.",

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy.

Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life.

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

However much our egos insist upon our separation from the rest of life, our instincts - the YVater side of us - remind us of our harmonv with the universe. Western culture has emphasized the idea of the individual as unique and separated from the world. The Tarot does not deny the individual’s uniqueness - it insists on it, through the uniqueness of readings - but instead describes the individual as a combination of elements (an astrology chart, with its twelve signs and twelve houses, teaches the same lesson). And one of those elements remains a person's basic- connection to the rest of life. The suit of Cups shows an inner experience that flows rather than defines, that opens rather than restricts. Cups represent love and imagination, joy and peace, a sense of harmony and wonder. They show us love as the Way to Spirit, both the love we give to others and the love we receive from people and from life itself in its happier moments. At times when life demands action, either physical or emotional, Cups represent the problem of passivity. All attempts to do anything, or to sort through some complicated problem, dissolve into vagueness, apathy, or empty dreams. Wands energize Cups, Swords define that emotional energy and give it direction, help it to figure things out (though an Air- storm will agitate the peaceful Water), while Pentacles bring the fantasies back to the ground of real projects.",

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

                "text": "The most successful and balanced of the Cups, in some ways of all the Minor cards, the Queen is almost a mundane version of the World Dancer. Coming between the outer responsibility of the King and the passiveness of the Knight, she shows the possibility of blending imagination and action, creativity and social usefulness. Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspira¬ tion for future activity from her or his past achievements. Compare her fierce gaze with the dreaminess of the Knight, or the cloudy fantasies of the Seven.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment.

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

                "text": "From the Nine reversed we move to an even clearer image of oppression. We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now. The reversed Eight means, in general, liberation from some",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help. Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, one's true plans or intentions. The isolation turns around to become communication, in par¬ ticular seeking advice on what to do about one's problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the act of finding help, such as consult¬ ing a reader or a therapist or simply friends. Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to deter¬ mine which course - independence or seeking advice — will produce the best results. A strange and powerful image, this card more than any other illustrates how Pamela Smith’s images reach beyond Arthur Waite's formulas.

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

In other words, the Basis did not come first and then give way to the Recent Past, but, like the small cross, the Recent Past came out of the general pattern shown by the Basis. Now, the Nine of Swords indicates sorrow, grief. It can at times sym¬ bolize mourning. In this case we can think of ‘mourning' as a metaphor. The person she grieves for is herself, for w'e have seen in the Basis that something has ‘died’. That something was not harmful, it had simply lost meaning. However, the fact that her life had gone beyond it did not stop her from missing the safe and comfortable ways of dealing with the world. Nor does the card really suggest that she misses her old self because she fears life. The sadness here is more genuine and, in fact, coexisted with the equally real joy and excitement I had seen before the reading. The first four cards have stressed her inner life; the next two showed the Tarot's ability to indicate trends and events, and in particular to give a warning. First the Possible Outcome. The Five of Swords reversed indicates defeat, producing shame and humiliation. Its presence here showed that despite all that the woman had accomplished her efforts might still come to nothing. Now, sometimes the Outcome card will clearly contradict the Possible Outcome, showing that for some reason the possibility will not become reality. Here the relationship is more subtle. The Hermit is a good indicator that she will not lose what she has gained, but it does not guarantee anything. It shows her headed in a good direction, but not yet arriving, at",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

Since an eight pointed star can be formed by placing one square over another with the points alternating, the octogram is sometimes thought of as halfway between the square and the circle. The square stands for matter and the circle for spirit. Human beings are the link between the spirit and the physical world; our ability to both feel the truth, and to act, makes us vehicles through which the truth can manifest itself. The Church used to describe humans as halfway between the animals and the angels. Usually a moral interpretation was given; people could follow their desires or their reason. But we can use this metaphor to say that human awareness and action connect the physical world to the ‘angels’. Despite all the suggestions of manifestations the Star is not really a card of action, but of inner calm. In contrast to Temperance and the Moon, the Star shows no road leading back from the pool to the mountains of outer reality. Though the streams and the ibis imply the uses of creative energy, the experience of the Star is one of peace. For the moment, the journey can wait. In divinatory readings the card expresses hope, a sense of healing and wholeness, especially after emotional storms. Very often the Star and the Tower suggest each other even when only one actually appears. Trump 17 indicates the unconscious activated, but in a very benign way. Reversed, we close ourselves off from the card’s calm and hope, experiencing weakness, impotence, and fear. This deep insecurity can sometimes mask itself as arrogance.

More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it.

Suppose the Star lies in the person’s Possible Outcome, indicating that the person might emerge feeling very free, full of hope, open to life. Suppose then that the Devil comes up as the actual Outcome, indicating bondage to an oppressive situation. What has gone wrong? If, say, the Nine of Swords reversed lies in the position of Basis, this would give us a clue, for it would say that the person holds inside her or him a sense of shame and humiliation coming from past weaknesses and fears, and that the ‘imprisonment’ symbolized in the Nine prevents the person from realizing the potential of the Star.

Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

Using the Tarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very tricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, usually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other systems. I have found it better to get a more general picture from the line, looking not just at physical condition but also emotional, spiritual health. One recommendation - observe which elements dominate. Strong Wands suggest good general health through the person’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie Nine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. Cups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual condition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker health or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for instance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of Major cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ ding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, would indicate good general health, Temperance would indicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- sickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can symbolize some special situation that has appeared or will appear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in the whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the beginning reader. The third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly the imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked at the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and awareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made conscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ tions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle level - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link between the two.",

We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Again the Page appears as the converse of the Knight. In reality the two of them split the Pentacles double qualities - practicality and magic.

In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of. seif-trust will often prove the most important. If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life. In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work. The Knight's responsibility for action brings",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it. A Tarot reading once produced the Fool crossed by the King of Pentacles",

Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general.

The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

There is scarcely any canon of criticism in matters of this kind. I suppose that in proportion as any system descends from generalities to details it becomes naturally the more precarious; and in the records of professional fortune-telling, it offers more of the dregs and lees of the subject. At the same time, divinations based on intuition and second sight are of little practical value unless they come down from the region of universals to that of particulars; but in proportion as this gift is present in a particular case, the specific meanings recorded by past cartomancists will be disregarded in favour of the personal appreciation of card values.

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

              "text": "In the Tarot we see the four elements as Fire-Wands (Staves), Water-Cups, Air-Swords, Earth-Pentacles (Coins). Different writers sometimes give variations on this listing, most often switching Wands and Fentacles, on the grounds that sticks grow out of the earth, and coins are forged in a fire. I have chosen to stay with the more common listing because of the wider associations of fire and earth. Fire is not simply a human tool, but a great force in nature, seen most powerfully in the sun which brings the staves out of the ground. Earth stands not only for the soil, but traditionally for the entire material universe of which Coins represent a small part and Pentacles a much wider part. If we wish to see the world in terms of five rather than four, including Spirit centre, then the Major Arcana stands for Ether, the fifth element. The fact that we set it apart from the four Minor elements symbolizes the intuition that Spirit somehow exists on a different level from the ordinary world. At the same time the fact that we mix all five together for readings helps us see that in reality Spirit and all the elements of matter constantly work together. Working with the Tarot helps us understand the dynamic ways in which Spirit gives meaning and unity to the material world. A true understan¬ ding of this relationship, in practice as well as theory, forms a great step towards that 'mastery’ described earlier. Many people will know the imagery of the four elements from astrology, with its four ‘triplicities’: Fire - Aries, Leo, Sagittarius; Water - Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; Air - Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; Earth - Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn. Jungian psychology also utilizes the four elements, linking them to basic ways of experiencing the world. Fire stands",

There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter. Let it be supposed that the question is: Will a lawsuit be necessary? In this case, take the Trump No. 11, or justice, as the Significator. This has reference to legal affairs. But if the question is: Shall I be successful in my lawsuit? one of the Court Cards must be chosen as the Significator. Subsequently, consecutive divinations may be performed to ascertain the course of the process itself and its result to each of the parties concerned.

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a person's emotional life, with a warm golden light. In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the",

              "text": "While this book will deal extensively with the concepts embodied in the cards and their symbolism it will also look carefully at the application of these concepts to Tarot readings. Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

Let the reader compare them with symbols like the Fool, the High Priestess, the Hierophant, or--almost without exception--with any in the previous sequence, and he will discern my meaning. There is no especial idea connected on the surface with the ordinary court cards; they are a bridge of conventions, which form a transition to the simple pretexts of the counters and denaries of the numbers following. We seem to have passed away utterly from the region of higher meanings illustrated by living pictures. There in was a period, however, when the numbered cards were also pictures, but such devices were sporadic inventions of particular artists and were either conventional designs of the typical or allegorical kind, distinct from what is understood by symbolism, or they were illustrations--shall we say?--of manners, customs and periods. They were, in a word, adornments, and as such they did nothing to raise the significance of the Lesser Arcana to the plane of the Trumps Major; moreover, such variations are exceedingly few. This notwithstanding, there are vague rumours concerning a higher meaning in the minor cards, but nothing has so far transpired, even within the sphere of prudence which belongs to the most occult circles; these, it is true, have certain variants in respect of divinatory values, but I have not heard that in practice they offer better results. Efforts like those of Papus in The Tarot ol the Bohemians are strenuous and deserving after their own kind; be, in particular, recognizes the elements of the Divine Immanence in the Trumps Major, and he seeks to",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about.

If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain. You will thus have seven new packets of six cards each, arranged as follows-- Take the top card of each packet, shuffle them and lay out from right to left, making a line of seven cards. Then take up the two next cards from each packet, shuffle and lay them out in two lines under the first line. Take up the remaining twenty-one cards of the packets, shuffle and lay them out in three lines below the others. You will thus have six horizontal lines of seven cards each, arranged after the following manner. In this method, the Querent--if of the male sex--is represented by the Magician, and if female by the High Priestess; but the card, in either case, is not taken from the pack until the forty-two cards have been laid out, as above directed.

In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or her. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ tunity. I have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In some readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with the others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms ’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- tions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as the Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of history, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian mystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through meditation on the cross and other methods of identification with Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the horizontal facts of their own physical existences.

                "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

However, if after interpreting this line, the reader and subject desire more information or simply another approach, the reader turns over a second line of seven directly below the first, and so on, until the meaning becomes clear. In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

                "text": "Another example will help illustrate this most valuable part of a Celtic Cross reading. The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or her. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ tunity. I have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In some readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with the others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms ’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- tions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as the Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of history, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian mystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through meditation on the cross and other methods of identification with Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the horizontal facts of their own physical existences. In many other cultures the image of a cross symbolizes the four horizontal directions along the surface of the earth, while the centre, the meeting place of the four, suggests the essentially vertical direction of the centre. The cross, therefore, also sym¬ bolizes the Tarot itself, the four arms being the four suits and the centre the Major Arcana.",

You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount.

The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the Oracles of Julia Orsini. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading into a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., constantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way the mandala creates new readings from the same images.",

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either magic signs or money, can influence the world without physically moving. Similarly, fire and air are constantly shifting, while water and earth tend more to inertia. A little reflection, as well as a look at the pictures, will show- how these separate categories actually blend together in reality. Both Wands and Pentacles deal with business, both Wands and Swords indicate conflict. Cups and Wands tend towards happy, positive experiences, while Pentacles and Swords often represent the more difficult sides of life. At the same time, Cups and Swords cover the general range of emotions, while Pentacles and Wands depict the more physical activities. Rather than showing rigid separations the cards tend toward combinations and the blurring of all distinctions. In Part One I wrote that the study of Tarot readings teaches us above all that no quality is good or bad except within the context of an actual situation. We learn also from readings that no situation, quality, or personal characteristic exists in isolation, but only in combination with others. In a reading we look first at the individual cards in their individual positions, but we understand what the reading tells us when we see how the cards blend together into a whole pattern. Similarly, we study the cards individually but we understand them fully only when we see them working. The",

                "text": "In the Tarot we see the four elements as Fire-Wands (Staves), Water-Cups, Air-Swords, Earth-Pentacles (Coins). Different writers sometimes give variations on this listing, most often switching Wands and Fentacles, on the grounds that sticks grow out of the earth, and coins are forged in a fire. I have chosen to stay with the more common listing because of the wider associations of fire and earth. Fire is not simply a human tool, but a great force in nature, seen most powerfully in the sun which brings the staves out of the ground. Earth stands not only for the soil, but traditionally for the entire material universe of which Coins represent a small part and Pentacles a much wider part. If we wish to see the world in terms of five rather than four, including Spirit centre, then the Major Arcana stands for Ether, the fifth element. The fact that we set it apart from the four Minor elements symbolizes the intuition that Spirit somehow exists on a different level from the ordinary world. At the same time the fact that we mix all five together for readings helps us see that in reality Spirit and all the elements of matter constantly work together. Working with the Tarot helps us understand the dynamic ways in which Spirit gives meaning and unity to the material world. A true understan¬ ding of this relationship, in practice as well as theory, forms a great step towards that 'mastery’ described earlier. Many people will know the imagery of the four elements from astrology, with its four ‘triplicities’: Fire - Aries, Leo, Sagittarius; Water - Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; Air - Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; Earth - Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn. Jungian psychology also utilizes the four elements, linking them to basic ways of experiencing the world. Fire stands",

There remain the four suits, being Wands or Sceptres--ex hypothesi, in the archaeology of the subject, the antecedents of Diamonds in modern cards: Cups, corresponding to Hearts; Swords, which answer to Clubs, as the weapon of chivalry is in relation to the peasant's quarter-staff or the Alsatian bludgeon; and, finally, Pentacles--called also Deniers and Money--which are the prototypes of Spades, In the old as in the new suits, there are ten numbered cards, but in the Tarot there are four Court Cards allocated to each suit, or a Knight in addition to King, Queen and Knave. The Knave is a page, valet, or damoiseau; most correctly, he is an esquire, presumably in the service of the Knight; but there are certain rare sets in which the page becomes a maid of honour, thus pairing the sexes in the tetrad of the court cards. There are naturally distinctive features in respect of the several pictures, by which I mean that the King of Wands is not exactly the same personage as the King of Cups, even after allowance has been made for the different emblems that they bear; but the symbolism resides in their rank and in the suit to which they belong. So also the smaller cards, which--until now--have never been issued pictorially in these our modem days, depend on the particular meaning attaching to their numbers in connexion with the particular suit. I reserve, therefore, the details of the Lesser Arcana, till I come to speak in the second part of the rectified and perfected Tarot which accompanies this work. The consensus of divinatory meanings attached both to the greater and lesser symbols belongs to the third part.",

The Court Cards in Cups signify people with light brown or dull fair hair and grey or blue eyes. Those in Swords stand for people having hazel or grey eyes, dark brown hair and dull complexion. Lastly, the Court Cards in Pentacles are referred to persons with very dark brown or black hair, dark eyes and sallow or swarthy complexions. These allocations are subject, however, to the following reserve, which will prevent them being taken too conventionally. You can be guided on occasion by the known temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly dark may be very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword card than a Pentacle. On the other hand, a very fair subject who is indolent and lethargic should be referred to Cups rather than to Wands. If it is more convenient for the purpose of a divination to take as the Significator the matter about which inquiry is to be made, that Trump or small card should be selected which has a meaning corresponding to the matter. Let it be supposed that the question is: Will a lawsuit be necessary? In this case, take the Trump No. 11, or justice, as the Significator. This has reference to legal affairs. But if the question is: Shall I be successful in my lawsuit? one of the Court Cards must be chosen as the Significator. Subsequently, consecutive divinations may be performed to ascertain the course of the process itself and its result to each of the parties concerned. Having selected the Significator, place it on the table, face upwards. Then shuffle and cut the rest of the pack three times, keeping the faces of the cards",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a person's emotional life, with a warm golden light. In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the",

Many writers, notably Waite, have denigrated divination as a degenerate use of the cards. But the proper use of readings can greatly increase our awareness of the cards’ meanings. It is one thing to study the symbolism of a particular card, it is something else to see that card in combination with others. Many times I have seen specific readings open up important meanings that would not have emerged in any other way. Readings teach us a general lesson as well, and a very important one. In a manner no explanation can possibly equal, they demonstrate that no card, no approach to life, is good or bad except in the context of the moment. Finally, giving readings gives each person a chance to renew his or her instinctive feeling for the pictures themselves. All the symbolism, all the archetypes, all the explanations given in this book or any other can only prepare you to look at the pictures and say, ‘This card tells me,..’. hrough its long history the Major Arcana has attracted a great many interpretations. Today, we tend to look upon the trumps as a psychological process, one that shows us passing through different stages of existence to reach a state of full development; we can describe this state, for the moment, as unity with the world around us, or perhaps liberation from weakness, confusion, and fear. The full Arcana describes this process in detail, but to get an under¬ standing of it as a whole we need look at only four cards; four basic archetypes arranged in a graphic pattern of evolution and spiritual aw'areness.",

There is no especial idea connected on the surface with the ordinary court cards; they are a bridge of conventions, which form a transition to the simple pretexts of the counters and denaries of the numbers following. We seem to have passed away utterly from the region of higher meanings illustrated by living pictures. There in was a period, however, when the numbered cards were also pictures, but such devices were sporadic inventions of particular artists and were either conventional designs of the typical or allegorical kind, distinct from what is understood by symbolism, or they were illustrations--shall we say?--of manners, customs and periods. They were, in a word, adornments, and as such they did nothing to raise the significance of the Lesser Arcana to the plane of the Trumps Major; moreover, such variations are exceedingly few. This notwithstanding, there are vague rumours concerning a higher meaning in the minor cards, but nothing has so far transpired, even within the sphere of prudence which belongs to the most occult circles; these, it is true, have certain variants in respect of divinatory values, but I have not heard that in practice they offer better results.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

                "text": "In different ways the reversed card shows a breakdown of the ideals symbolized right side up. It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: If you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the diagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation you can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, or let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving the images about. Since the mandala contains all the elements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could maintain balance by taking the image into herself. If you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge between the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands are obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of Pentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of Wands reversed will also provide new meanings when we consider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed and the Six of Swords.

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "The Ace of Swords, as the Outcome card showed the strong attitude as well as the sharp perceptive mind she would need, and find, to open up the current situation. The Result of this Outcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the gamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

                "text": "In astrology and Jungian thought the elements stand for types and characteristics. In the Tarot we see these types reflected in the court cards. The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

                "text": "But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'.

In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

Notice that in contrast to the Nine the sky clears in the distance, the black clouds give way to sunshine, and that in contrast to the Five or the Two, the water lies placidly. The situation is not so bad as it looks. '['urn this card round and we can imagine the swords failing out of his back. Waite describes it as success and advantage, but not permanent. These ideas suggest that when a situation changes, the problems may go away for the moment. However, the person must now take advantage of this relief by making a real change in her or his condition - either practical or mental, depending on the need — so that the situation will not revert to what it w-as. The card bears a relationship to the Ten of Wands reversed, where we saw the danger of picking up the sticks again once the situation has calmed down. The image of deepest sorrow, of utmost mental pain. Where the Queen frees herself by turning sorrow into wisdom, and the Three suggests the calm of acceptance, the Nine shows the moment of agony, of dissolution. The Swords do not stick in her back, but hang in the black air above her. Very often the Nine refers not to something happening directly to us, but rather to someone we love. Love, in fact, fills the card and gives it its meaning. The blanket design shows roses, symbol of passion, alternating with the signs of the zodiac. In the card’s deepest sense it shows",

                "text": "In many cases, of course, the pictures are very simple and directly related to the meanings they were meant to illustrate. The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art.

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.

                "text": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development.

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

It is worth repeating here the original example which suggested the symbolism of crossed time. The reading was done for a man unsure of the direction of his life. A long love affair was ending, his chosen career as a professional singer had not materialized. The reading began with the High Priestess crossed by the Hiero¬ phant. Now these cards, sometimes called the Papess and the Pope, at first glance represent contradictory values. The High Priestess stands for instinct, mystery, stillness, while the Hierophant, as the preacher of a doctrine by which people may guide their lives, stands for orthodoxy, planned behaviour, clarity. Therefore, it appeared that the two sym¬ bolized conflicting approaches to life. The more I looked at them, however, with their religious imagery, the more I thought of conjunctions, rather than opposites. The two seemed to prescribe almost a way of dealing with life. The High Priestess indicated that within himself this man carried qualities of instinct and understanding that might never fully emerge but could give his life substance. The Hierophant, on the other hand, showed that in his daily life he needed a more rational plan of action; he needed to organize and make definite decisions to achieve what he wanted. But these plans and practical steps would work best if backed by his own instincts and inner awareness rather than by socially- acceptable ideas of proper goals and behaviour. Just as I was trying to explain how these qualities could complement each other the man broke in to say how he saw them as constantly",

                "text": "Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

                "text": "To the right stand a monk and an architect holding the plans of the church. Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

                "text": "The very mundaneness of day-to-day life ensures, by a kind of law of reciprocity, that such things possess a greater ‘magic’ than the more immediate attractions of the other elements. We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it. A Tarot reading once produced the Fool crossed by the King of Pentacles",

                "text": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

                "text": "Because material gifts exist in a way that the gifts of the other Aces do not, they are more open to abuse. The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

                "text": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

There is scarcely any canon of criticism in matters of this kind. I suppose that in proportion as any system descends from generalities to details it becomes naturally the more precarious; and in the records of professional fortune-telling, it offers more of the dregs and lees of the subject. At the same time, divinations based on intuition and second sight are of little practical value unless they come down from the region of universals to that of particulars; but in proportion as this gift is present in a particular case, the specific meanings recorded by past cartomancists will be disregarded in favour of the personal appreciation of card values.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life.

                "text": "to study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

However much our egos insist upon our separation from the rest of life, our instincts - the YVater side of us - remind us of our harmonv with the universe. Western culture has emphasized the idea of the individual as unique and separated from the world. The Tarot does not deny the individual’s uniqueness - it insists on it, through the uniqueness of readings - but instead describes the individual as a combination of elements (an astrology chart, with its twelve signs and twelve houses, teaches the same lesson). And one of those elements remains a person's basic- connection to the rest of life. The suit of Cups shows an inner experience that flows rather than defines, that opens rather than restricts. Cups represent love and imagination, joy and peace, a sense of harmony and wonder. They show us love as the Way to Spirit, both the love we give to others and the love we receive from people and from life itself in its happier moments. At times when life demands action, either physical or emotional, Cups represent the problem of passivity. All attempts to do anything, or to sort through some complicated problem, dissolve into vagueness, apathy, or empty dreams. Wands energize Cups, Swords define that emotional energy and give it direction, help it to figure things out (though an Air- storm will agitate the peaceful Water), while Pentacles bring the fantasies back to the ground of real projects.",

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspira¬ tion for future activity from her or his past achievements.

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring.

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ ticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as",

The picture on the right at the start of this section, from Paul Foster Case’s Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) deck drawn by Jessie Burns Parke, illustrates another tradition. Here the Emperor symbolizes the sum total of spiritual knowledge. He is drawn in profile (this is much more common than the Rider pack full face image), linking them to the Qabalist image for God as the ‘Ancient of Days’, a seated king in profile. (The Ancient’s face was never visible, only his crown with a radiance beneath.) The Emperor’s arms and legs form an equilateral triangle over a cross, the alchemical sign for fire. This figure is later reversed (in Waite as well as Case) in the Hanged Man. As mentioned above, the crossed legs are an esoteric sign, found also on the card of the World. The BOTA Emperor sits on a cube rather than a throne. Also an esoteric symbol, the cube symbolizes both the world and the Tarot itself, as well as the Hebrew alphabet and the paths of the Tree of Life. The symbolism arises from the fact that a cube contains twelve edges, six faces, three axes, and of course a centre, adding up to twenty-two, the number of trumps, Hebrew letters, and paths. And because the Tree of Life is held to represent all creation the cube symbolizes the universe. In readings the Emperor indicates (following the Rider pack image) the power of society, its laws and especially its authority to enforce those laws. The appearance of the trump indicates an encounter with the law. Again, the good or bad qualities depend on the context.",

He holds an ankh, Egyptian symbol of life, to indicate that under the law he bears the power of life and death, and will hopefully use it well. Four rams, symbols of Aries, adorn his throne while at the crown’s peak he bears the sign of Aries (unfortunately resembling a propellor). Now, Aries symbolizes force, aggression and war, but as the first sign of the zodiac it also signifies the new life of spring, which can emerge from the stability of a just society. As the middle card of the first line of the Major Arcana the Emperor represents a crucial test. In the process of growing up it is indeed the rules of society that many people find most difficult to surmount. We must absorb these rules, as well as our society’s traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude ‘rules are made to be broken’. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly. Because of the father’s role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mother’s, rather than their own, passions and sensuality.

He also can indicate a specific person who holds great power, either objective or emotional, over the subject. This is very often the father, but it can also be a husband or lover, especially for those people who treat their lovers as substitute fathers to whom they surrender control of their lives. I have seen readings so dominated by the Emperor that all of life’s possibilities become stunted and unfulfilled. Like the Empress reversed, the Emperor, when upside down, receives those elements complementary to his qualities when he is the right way up. He is, in Waite’s terms, ‘benevolence and compassion’; new life in a stony desert. But the pendulum can swing too far. The reversed Emperor can signify immaturity, and the inability to make harsh decisions and carry them through.",

                "text": "Trumps 3 and 4 of the Tarot represent the parents in their archetypal roles. But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world ‘married’ to nature. He symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them. In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddess’s representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. We see this drama (much like Freud’s substitution of super-ego for id) in many myths; such as Marduk, national hero of Babylon, killing Tiamat, the original mother of creation, because she is giving birth to monsters. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature. In Rome, the concept of law versus chaos was carried to the point where stability, or ‘law and order’ to use the modern term, became virtues in themselves, apart from the inherent morality of those laws. No progress can be made in conditions of anarchy (runs the argument); bad laws need to be changed, but first the law must be obeyed at all costs. Any other approach can only destroy society. Today, we see this viewpoint embodied in an abstraction we call the ‘system’. The Romans saw it more concretely in the personal figure of the Emperor,",

He is executive and realization, the power of this world, here clothed with the highest of its natural attributes. He is occasionally represented as seated on a cubic stone, which, however, confuses some of the issues. He is the virile power, to which the Empress responds, and in this sense is he who seeks to remove the Veil of Isis; yet she remains virgo intacta. It should be understood that this card and that of the Empress do not precisely represent the condition of married life, though this state is implied. On the surface, as I have indicated, they stand for mundane royalty, uplifted on the seats of the mighty; but above this there is the suggestion of another presence. They signify also--and the male figure especially--the higher kingship, occupying the intellectual throne. Hereof is the lordship of thought rather than of the animal world. Both personalities, after their own manner, are \"full of strange experience,\" but theirs is not consciously the wisdom which draws from a higher world. The Emperor has been described as (a) will in its embodied form, but this is only one of its applications, and (b) as an expression of virtualities contained in the Absolute Being--but this is fantasy.

The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience. Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental - forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way. Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.",

The symbolism arises from the fact that a cube contains twelve edges, six faces, three axes, and of course a centre, adding up to twenty-two, the number of trumps, Hebrew letters, and paths. And because the Tree of Life is held to represent all creation the cube symbolizes the universe. In readings the Emperor indicates (following the Rider pack image) the power of society, its laws and especially its authority to enforce those laws.

Now, Aries symbolizes force, aggression and war, but as the first sign of the zodiac it also signifies the new life of spring, which can emerge from the stability of a just society. As the middle card of the first line of the Major Arcana the Emperor represents a crucial test. In the process of growing up it is indeed the rules of society that many people find most difficult to surmount. We must absorb these rules, as well as our society’s traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude ‘rules are made to be broken’. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly. Because of the father’s role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mother’s, rather than their own, passions and sensuality.

We must absorb these rules, as well as our society’s traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude ‘rules are made to be broken’. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly. Because of the father’s role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mother’s, rather than their own, passions and sensuality. The idea of the Emperor as that of the limited values of social",

                "text": "Trumps 3 and 4 of the Tarot represent the parents in their archetypal roles. But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world ‘married’ to nature. He symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them. In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddess’s representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. We see this drama (much like Freud’s substitution of super-ego for id) in many myths; such as Marduk, national hero of Babylon, killing Tiamat, the original mother of creation, because she is giving birth to monsters. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature. In Rome, the concept of law versus chaos was carried to the point where stability, or ‘law and order’ to use the modern term, became virtues in themselves, apart from the inherent morality of those laws. No progress can be made in conditions of anarchy (runs the argument); bad laws need to be changed, but first the law must be obeyed at all costs. Any other approach can only destroy society. Today, we see this viewpoint embodied in an abstraction we call the ‘system’. The Romans saw it more concretely in the personal figure of the Emperor,",

                "text": "But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

This is the colportage interpretation, and it has the same correspondence with the real symbolical meaning that the use of the Tarot in fortune-telling has with its mystic construction according to the secret science of symbolism. I should add that many independent students of the subject, following their own lights, have produced individual sequences of meaning in respect of the Trumps Major, and their lights are sometimes suggestive, but they are not the true lights. For example, Eliphas Levi says that the Magus signifies that unity which is the mother of numbers; others say that it is the Divine Unity; and one of the latest French commentators considers that in its general sense it is the will. 2. The High Priestess, the Pope Joan, or Female Pontiff; early expositors have sought to term this card the Mother, or Pope's Wife, which is opposed to the symbolism. It is sometimes held to represent the Divine Law and the Gnosis, in which case the Priestess corresponds to the idea of the Shekinah. She is the Secret Tradition and the higher sense of the instituted Mysteries. 3. The Empress, who is sometimes represented with full face, while her correspondence, the Emperor, is in profile. As there has been some tendency to ascribe a symbolical significance to this distinction, it seems desirable to say that it carries no inner meaning. The Empress has been connected with the ideas of universal fecundity and in a general sense with activity.",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

                "text": "In many cases, of course, the pictures are very simple and directly related to the meanings they were meant to illustrate. The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help. Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, one's true plans or intentions. The isolation turns around to become communication, in par¬ ticular seeking advice on what to do about one's problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the act of finding help, such as consult¬ ing a reader or a therapist or simply friends. Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to deter¬ mine which course - independence or seeking advice — will produce the best results.

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

In other words, the Basis did not come first and then give way to the Recent Past, but, like the small cross, the Recent Past came out of the general pattern shown by the Basis. Now, the Nine of Swords indicates sorrow, grief. It can at times sym¬ bolize mourning. In this case we can think of ‘mourning' as a metaphor. The person she grieves for is herself, for w'e have seen in the Basis that something has ‘died’. That something was not harmful, it had simply lost meaning. However, the fact that her life had gone beyond it did not stop her from missing the safe and comfortable ways of dealing with the world. Nor does the card really suggest that she misses her old self because she fears life. The sadness here is more genuine and, in fact, coexisted with the equally real joy and excitement I had seen before the reading. The first four cards have stressed her inner life; the next two showed the Tarot's ability to indicate trends and events, and in particular to give a warning. First the Possible Outcome. The Five of Swords reversed indicates defeat, producing shame and humiliation. Its presence here showed that despite all that the woman had accomplished her efforts might still come to nothing. Now, sometimes the Outcome card will clearly contradict the Possible Outcome, showing that for some reason the possibility will not become reality. Here the relationship is more subtle. The Hermit is a good indicator that she will not lose what she has gained, but it does not guarantee anything. It shows her headed in a good direction, but not yet arriving, at",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

                "text": "In other situations, if the Page refers to psychic develop¬ ment, or true visions, then reversed shows a person disturbed by these visions. For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

Where the Knight is the prototypical worker the Page represents the student, lost in his studies, fascinated, feeling little concern for anything outside them. Nevertheless he partakes of the suit's practical nature by symbolizing the actual work of the student, the study and scholarship, as compared to the inspiration sym¬ bolized by the Page of Cups. The student here acts as a symbol; the Page need not refer to someone actually in school, but simply anyone approaching any activity with those qualities of fascination, of involvement, of caring less for rewards or social position than for the work itself. Again the Page appears as the converse of the Knight. In reality the two of them split the Pentacles double qualities - practicality and magic. Where the Knight, without his job, becomes discouraged and inert, the Page, without his sense of hard work, gives way to wildness and dissipation, what Waite calls ‘prodigality'. Sometimes, however, the card can mean simply relaxation after a difficult task, like a student unwind¬ ing after examinations.",

                "text": "The image in Fig. 48(b), slightly different from the official Rider version (Fig. 48(a)), comes from an American edition of several years ago. In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

                "text": "Her qualities, as well as the sexual symbolism, relate her to the patron of Pentacles, the Empress. At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of. seif-trust will often prove the most important. If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life. In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work. The Knight's responsibility for action brings",

                "text": "The card bears a (distorted) relationship to all those Major cards (the Hierophant, the Lovers, the Devil, and others) in which some force holds together or reconciles the opposites of life. Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

                "text": "Briefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed",

                "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

But it connects as well to Cups, with their emphasis on imagination and instinct. The Fool, in fact, combines these two suits. Later we will see that this combination, fire and water, represents the way of transformation. Finally the question arises of the Fool’s place in divinatory readings. I have already mentioned the importance of readings for a fuller understanding of the cards. Even more, they help us apply the wisdom of the cards to our daily lives. In readings the Fool speaks to us of courage and optimism, urging faith in ourselves and in life. At difficult times, when we come under pressure from people around us to be practical, the Fool reminds us that our own inner selves can best tell us what to do. The Fool can often symbolize beginnings, courageously leaping off into some new phase of life, particularly when that leap is taken from some deep feeling rather than careful planning. These belong to the Fool in its normal position. We must also consider the ‘reversed’ meanings, that is, when the way we have mixed the cards makes the Fool come out with the feet on the top. Reversed meanings are controversial among Tarot commentators. Those who give formulas as meanings usually just turn the formula around, a simplistic method which has led several interpreters to abandon the whole idea of reversed meanings. But we can also look at reversals as deepening the meaning of the card as a whole. In general, a reversed card indicates that the qualities of that card have become blocked, distorted or channelled in another direction. For the Fool a reversal means",

                "text": "Another reversed meaning of the Fool will appear at first to contradict the one just given. Recklessness, wildness, crazy schemes all seem the opposite of over-caution. And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing. This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to the Fool - the awareness that great chances must be taken only at the proper time. There are, after all, many times when caution is needed, and times when it is better to do nothing at all. The basic thing any oracle teaches us is that no action or attitude is right or wrong, except in its proper context. As wc go further into the Tarot we will see that this concept of the proper time permeates the cards and is, in fact, the true key to their correct use. The card in the Rider pack that falls exactly in the middle of the three lines, that is, Justice, means a proper response. The Magician emerges very directly from the Fool in the image of the trickster-wizard. As mentioned above, Merlin fulfils both these roles (as well as that of teacher and wise man), and many other myths make the same connection. Earlier Tarot decks pictured trump number one as a conjurer rather than a magus, or even a juggler tossing coloured balls in the air. Charles Williams described him as a juggler tossing the stars and planets.",

Perhaps such a radiant self never really existed. Somehow we experience our intuition of it as something lost. Virtually every culture has developed a myth of a Fall from a primeval paradise. ‘Innocence’ is a word often misunderstood. It does not mean without guilt’ but rather a freedom and a total openness to life, a complete lack of fear that comes through a total faith in living and in your own instinctive self. Innocence does not mean ‘asexual’ as some people think. It is sexuality expressed without fear, without guilt, without connivance and dishonesty. It is sexuality expressed spontaneously and freely, as the expression of love and the ecstasy of life. The Fool bears the number 0 because all things are possible to the person who is always ready to go in any direction. He does not belong in any specific place; he is not fixed like the other cards. His innocence makes him a person with no past, and therefore an infinite future. Every moment is a new starting point. In Arabic numerals the number 0 bears the shape of an egg, to indicate that all things emerge from it. Originally the zero was written as a dot; in Hermetic and Qabalistic tradition the universe emerged from a single point of light. And God in the Qabalah is often described as ‘nothingness’ because to describe God as any thing would be to limit Him to some finite fixed state.

A large volume would be required for developments of this kind. I have taken the cards on the high plane of their more direct significance to man, who--in material life--is on the quest of eternal things. The compiler of the Manual of Cartomancy has treated them under three headings: the World of Human Prudence, which does not differ from divination on its more serious side; the World of Conformity, being the life of religious devotion; and the World of Attainment, which is that of \"the soul's progress towards the term of its research.\" He gives also a triple process of consultation, according to these divisions, to which the reader is referred. I have no such process to offer, as I think that more may be gained by individual reflection on each of the Trumps Major. I have also not adopted the prevailing attribution of the cards to the Hebrew alphabet--firstly, because it would serve no purpose in an elementary handbook; secondly, because nearly every attribution is wrong. Finally, I have not attempted to rectify the position of the cards in their relation to one another; the Zero therefore appears after No. 20, but I have taken care not to number the World or Universe otherwise than as 21. Wherever it ought to be put, the Zero is an unnumbered card. In conclusion as to this part, I will give these further indications regarding the Fool, which is the most speaking of all the symbols.

The joker, of course, descends directly from the Fool of tarochhi. The rivalry of Batman and the Joker sends a clear message to their readers: do not rebel against social values. Support law and order. In recent years the magazine has described the Joker as insane rather than criminal. To society the way of the Fool, instinct rather than rules, is a dangerous insanity. So far we have looked at the Fool as the ‘other’, prodding us from complacency with his jokes and disguises. As the ‘self’ he represents that long tradition of the foolish brother or sister, despised by the",

Because the Fool does not follow their rules or share their weaknesses, he appears to them in this ugly distorted way. Haich describes the Fool’s face as a mask, put there not by himself but by the outside world. The last card, the World, presents the same enlightened person, but viewed from inside, that is, by himself. In some early Tarot decks the Fool appeared as a giant court jester, towering over the people around him. His title was ‘the Fool of God’. The term has also been used for idiots, harmless madmen, and severe epileptics, all of whom were thought to be in touch with a greater wisdom precisely because they were out of touch with the rest of us.

And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing. This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to the Fool - the awareness that great chances must be taken only at the proper time. There are, after all, many times when caution is needed, and times when it is better to do nothing at all. The basic thing any oracle teaches us is that no action or attitude is right or wrong, except in its proper context. As wc go further into the Tarot we will see that this concept of the proper time permeates the cards and is, in fact, the true key to their correct use. The card in the Rider pack that falls exactly in the middle of the three lines, that is, Justice, means a proper response. The Magician emerges very directly from the Fool in the image of the trickster-wizard. As mentioned above, Merlin fulfils both these roles (as well as that of teacher and wise man), and many other myths make the same connection. Earlier Tarot decks pictured trump number one as a conjurer rather than a magus, or even a juggler tossing coloured balls in the air. Charles Williams described him as a juggler tossing the stars and planets.",

Consider two people with the same outer worlds - both successful, respected, wealthy; yet inwardly one may be tense, or frustrated, or afraid, while the other remains joyful and at peace. If we see the Fool as the beginning of the Major Arcana, the King of Pentacles as the final card of the Minor, then the two stand at opposite ends of the Tarot. But this polarity holds true only if we see the cards in a line. If we envision them in a circle, then the Fool and the King of Pentacles become joined together. The King is meant for success. Reversing him suggests failure or simply mediocrity. The lack of fulfilment brings dissatisfac¬ tion, feelings of weakness, and doubt. Taken another way we can see the upside down King as symbolizing the idea of success corrupted, the image of a man or a woman who will use any means to achieve his or her goals. If we describe the King of Pentacles as someone who needs a vital connection with nature (and not everyone does, despite contemporary assumptions), the King reversed stands for the state of being cut off from that rejuvenating Row. Here too the break results in dissatisfaction, weakness, even psychic danger. Where the King sits before a castle the Queen's throne stands entirely in a field, framed by roses. Where the King simply glances at his Pentacle, the Queen holds hers in both hands, intensely aware of the magic in nature and the strength she derives from it.

But we can look at the Fool from another side - the leap into the archetypal world of the trumps. Imagine yourself entering a strange landscape. A world of magicians, of people hanging upside down, and of dancers in the bright air. You can enter through a leap from a height, through a dark cave, a labyrinth, or even by climbing down a rabbit hole chasing a Victorian rabbit with a pocket watch. Whichever way you choose, you are a fool to do it. Why look into the deep world of the mind when you can stay safely in the ordinary landscape of job, home and family? Herman Melville, in Moby Dick , warned his readers not to take even a step outside the ordinary path laid out for you by society. You might not get back again. And yet, for those willing to take the chance, the leap can bring joy, adventure, and finally, for those with the courage to keep going when the wonderland becomes more fearsome than joyous, the leap can bring knowledge, peace, and liberation. Interestingly, the Fool archetype appears more in mythology than in structured religion. An institutionalized Church can hardly urge people beyond the limits of institutions. Instead, the churches offer us a safe haven from the fears of life. Mythology leads directly into the heart of those fears, and in every culture the mythological landscape contains the image of the Trickster - pushing, goading, jabbing the kings and heroes whenever they turn away from the inner world of truth.",

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of",

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite. Waite included a much lighter reading for the reversed Ace: ‘Clouded joy’. Then the Ace becomes",

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal. Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action. The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side. The Five reversed brings to mind again that phrase 'the fire has gone out’. The number four, with its image of the square, implies stasis",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

In each suit it shows that element in its maturity. With Wands this becomes accomplishment. The figure is shown strong, but at rest, unthreatened. The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a person's emotional life, with a warm golden light. In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the",

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

                "text": "Fire implies swiftness and movement. Though this movement sometimes lacks direction we see here the image of a journey reaching an end, or things completed. When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

                "text": "Notice in this last example that the Two of Cups reversed might be a fear, but it might also be a hope. We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duality of Hopes and Fears shows up most strongly in cards dealing with change, or the emergence from confined situations to open ones. Death, the Eight of Cups, the Two of Wands reversed, and the Four of Wands all deal with these themes of freedom and change. Some others are the Devil reversed, the Eight of Swords reversed, and the Star. Very often if the subject and the reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of these images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence will emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. Because the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or success), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains hidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this ambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or she really wants. Seeing this duality at work in one reading after another teaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning. The subconscious (the repressed material we might call the lower layer of the ego - again, see footnote on page 157) is basically",

                "text": "Usually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

Since an eight pointed star can be formed by placing one square over another with the points alternating, the octogram is sometimes thought of as halfway between the square and the circle. The square stands for matter and the circle for spirit. Human beings are the link between the spirit and the physical world; our ability to both feel the truth, and to act, makes us vehicles through which the truth can manifest itself. The Church used to describe humans as halfway between the animals and the angels. Usually a moral interpretation was given; people could follow their desires or their reason. But we can use this metaphor to say that human awareness and action connect the physical world to the ‘angels’. Despite all the suggestions of manifestations the Star is not really a card of action, but of inner calm. In contrast to Temperance and the Moon, the Star shows no road leading back from the pool to the mountains of outer reality. Though the streams and the ibis imply the uses of creative energy, the experience of the Star is one of peace. For the moment, the journey can wait. In divinatory readings the card expresses hope, a sense of healing and wholeness, especially after emotional storms. Very often the Star and the Tower suggest each other even when only one actually appears. Trump 17 indicates the unconscious activated, but in a very benign way. Reversed, we close ourselves off from the card’s calm and hope, experiencing weakness, impotence, and fear. This deep insecurity can sometimes mask itself as arrogance. If the Star indicates the human as a link between the spirit and the outer world then the card reversed symbolizes the channels",

More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it. Keep your eyes closed or opened, depending on what works for you; most people find that at least when the fantasy starts they prefer their eyes closed. Try to",

In these situations I read the Possible Outcome as something that might have happened but will not. The task then is to look at the other cards for the reason why the outcome should happen instead. Suppose the Star lies in the person’s Possible Outcome, indicating that the person might emerge feeling very free, full of hope, open to life. Suppose then that the Devil comes up as the actual Outcome, indicating bondage to an oppressive situation. What has gone wrong? If, say, the Nine of Swords reversed lies in the position of Basis, this would give us a clue, for it would say that the person holds inside her or him a sense of shame and humiliation coming from past weaknesses and fears, and that the ‘imprisonment’ symbolized in the Nine prevents the person from realizing the potential of the Star. These examples will help us to see that the true meaning of a Tarot reading does not come from specific cards but rather from the configurations they form together.",

Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

Using the Tarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very tricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, usually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other systems. I have found it better to get a more general picture from the line, looking not just at physical condition but also emotional, spiritual health. One recommendation - observe which elements dominate. Strong Wands suggest good general health through the person’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie Nine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. Cups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual condition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker health or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for instance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of Major cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ ding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, would indicate good general health, Temperance would indicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- sickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can symbolize some special situation that has appeared or will appear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in the whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the beginning reader. The third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly the imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked at the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and awareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made conscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ tions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle level - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link between the two.",

                "text": "In Part One of this book I wrote that readings partake of both the Magician and the High Priestess principles, con¬ sciousness and intuition. We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot. Most people know their own sun signs and if not the reader can readily determine it from the birthday. Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

The bull's head should be noted as a recurrent symbol on the throne. The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.

Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the rope...\n  - In many cases, of course, the pictures are very simple and directly related to the meanings they were meant to illustrate.

But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover ...\n  - dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit. The first thing to observe about this card is that it does not show success or fai...\n\nTwo of Pentacles (crossing位置):\n  - A young man, leaning on his staff, looks intently at seven pentacles attached to a clump of greenery on his right; one would say that these were his treasures and that his heart was there. Divinatory Meanings: These are exceedingly contradictory; in the main, it is a card of money, business, barter;...\n  - To the right stand a monk and an architect holding the plans of the church. Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, s...\n  - A sculptor at his work in a monastery. Compare the design which illustrates the Eight of Pentacles.

You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) People sometimes find themselves left with the question, ‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give suggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ dmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a person needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As a simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person ‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it eventually will bring good results.’ There are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ times ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I followed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this particular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ rent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In other words, what are the possible changes I can make? To emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a new layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and partly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries three innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards advice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after the reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out more cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the reader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. The structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows the reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ tions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from different sides.",

The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which is entitled \"The Divining Tarot\"; it may be recommended at its proper value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E. Waite, ill. by Pamela Colman Smith [1911], at sacred-texts.com This mode of divination is the most suitable for obtaining an answer to a definite question. The Diviner first selects a card to represent the person or, matter about which inquiry is made. This card is called the Significator. Should he wish to ascertain something in connexion with himself he takes the one which corresponds to his personal description. A Knight should be chosen as the Significator if the subject of inquiry is a man of forty years old and upward; a King should be chosen for any male who is under that age a Queen for a woman",

Deal out the first forty-two cards in six packets of seven cards each, face upwards, so that the first seven cards form the first packet, the following seven the second, and so on-as in the following diagram:-- Take up the first packet; lay out the cards on the table in a row, from right to left; place the cards of the second packet upon them and then the packets which remain.

In each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their specific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being Past Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the older form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude to the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the same way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. Together, the two cards show what has happened and what the person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. The next three cards depart more strongly from the older system. They show what I call the Work - situations, influences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. In the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This is the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even opportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ tion - and can change it. When I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to each position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in the left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it better to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to interpret them together as simply what the person has to work with in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the same time the three designations are worth remembering, for one or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in specific readings.",

More, it balances them out and shows which influences are strongest, and how they work together to produce the result. Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome appears desirable then a similar study can help increase those influences, already strong, which are tending towards that result. The Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed number of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture ambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards without a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In turning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five (sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at times the initial reading has served as the basis for turning over most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more difficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid using them. Sometimes we may do further readings to get information about a specific card in the first reading. We might have a question about a person referred to in the Near Future position. In this situation some readers will use the card in question as the Significator for the new reading, just as the original Significator helped the person to concentrate on him or herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ ticular question.

              "text": "Another example will help illustrate this most valuable part of a Celtic Cross reading. The Ace of Cups in the Centre would indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more precisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent opportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two would imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and will use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a different meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude that prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or her. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ tunity. I have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In some readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with the others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms ’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- tions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as the Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of history, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian mystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through meditation on the cross and other methods of identification with Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the horizontal facts of their own physical existences. In many other cultures the image of a cross symbolizes the four horizontal directions along the surface of the earth, while the centre, the meeting place of the four, suggests the essentially vertical direction of the centre. The cross, therefore, also sym¬ bolizes the Tarot itself, the four arms being the four suits and the centre the Major Arcana.",

              "text": "explanations such as ‘best possible outcome’ for the positions. Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

But it connects as well to Cups, with their emphasis on imagination and instinct. The Fool, in fact, combines these two suits. Later we will see that this combination, fire and water, represents the way of transformation. Finally the question arises of the Fool’s place in divinatory readings. I have already mentioned the importance of readings for a fuller understanding of the cards. Even more, they help us apply the wisdom of the cards to our daily lives. In readings the Fool speaks to us of courage and optimism, urging faith in ourselves and in life. At difficult times, when we come under pressure from people around us to be practical, the Fool reminds us that our own inner selves can best tell us what to do. The Fool can often symbolize beginnings, courageously leaping off into some new phase of life, particularly when that leap is taken from some deep feeling rather than careful planning. These belong to the Fool in its normal position. We must also consider the ‘reversed’ meanings, that is, when the way we have mixed the cards makes the Fool come out with the feet on the top. Reversed meanings are controversial among Tarot commentators. Those who give formulas as meanings usually just turn the formula around, a simplistic method which has led several interpreters to abandon the whole idea of reversed meanings. But we can also look at reversals as deepening the meaning of the card as a whole. In general, a reversed card indicates that the qualities of that card have become blocked, distorted or channelled in another direction. For the Fool a reversal means",

                "text": "Another reversed meaning of the Fool will appear at first to contradict the one just given. Recklessness, wildness, crazy schemes all seem the opposite of over-caution. And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing. This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to the Fool - the awareness that great chances must be taken only at the proper time. There are, after all, many times when caution is needed, and times when it is better to do nothing at all. The basic thing any oracle teaches us is that no action or attitude is right or wrong, except in its proper context. As wc go further into the Tarot we will see that this concept of the proper time permeates the cards and is, in fact, the true key to their correct use. The card in the Rider pack that falls exactly in the middle of the three lines, that is, Justice, means a proper response. The Magician emerges very directly from the Fool in the image of the trickster-wizard. As mentioned above, Merlin fulfils both these roles (as well as that of teacher and wise man), and many other myths make the same connection. Earlier Tarot decks pictured trump number one as a conjurer rather than a magus, or even a juggler tossing coloured balls in the air. Charles Williams described him as a juggler tossing the stars and planets.",

A large volume would be required for developments of this kind. I have taken the cards on the high plane of their more direct significance to man, who--in material life--is on the quest of eternal things. The compiler of the Manual of Cartomancy has treated them under three headings: the World of Human Prudence, which does not differ from divination on its more serious side; the World of Conformity, being the life of religious devotion; and the World of Attainment, which is that of \"the soul's progress towards the term of its research.\" He gives also a triple process of consultation, according to these divisions, to which the reader is referred. I have no such process to offer, as I think that more may be gained by individual reflection on each of the Trumps Major. I have also not adopted the prevailing attribution of the cards to the Hebrew alphabet--firstly, because it would serve no purpose in an elementary handbook; secondly, because nearly every attribution is wrong. Finally, I have not attempted to rectify the position of the cards in their relation to one another; the Zero therefore appears after No. 20, but I have taken care not to number the World or Universe otherwise than as 21. Wherever it ought to be put, the Zero is an unnumbered card. In conclusion as to this part, I will give these further indications regarding the Fool, which is the most speaking of all the symbols. He signifies the journey outward, the state of the first emanation, the graces and passivity of the spirit. His wallet is inscribed with dim signs, to shew that",

Because the Fool does not follow their rules or share their weaknesses, he appears to them in this ugly distorted way. Haich describes the Fool’s face as a mask, put there not by himself but by the outside world. The last card, the World, presents the same enlightened person, but viewed from inside, that is, by himself. In some early Tarot decks the Fool appeared as a giant court jester, towering over the people around him. His title was ‘the Fool of God’. The term has also been used for idiots, harmless madmen, and severe epileptics, all of whom were thought to be in touch with a greater wisdom precisely because they were out of touch with the rest of us. The archetype persists in modern popular mythology as well. By their fantastic primitive nature comic books often reflect mythological themes better than novels. In Batman the hero’s strongest enemy is called the Joker, a figure who has no past and is never seen without the wild make-up of a joker in a deck of cards. The joker, of course, descends directly from the Fool of tarochhi. The rivalry of Batman and the Joker sends a clear message to their readers: do not rebel against social values. Support law and order. In recent years the magazine has described the Joker as insane rather than criminal. To society the way of the Fool, instinct rather than rules, is a dangerous insanity. So far we have looked at the Fool as the ‘other’, prodding us from complacency with his jokes and disguises. As the ‘self’ he represents that long tradition of the foolish brother or sister, despised by the",

Perhaps such a radiant self never really existed. Somehow we experience our intuition of it as something lost. Virtually every culture has developed a myth of a Fall from a primeval paradise. ‘Innocence’ is a word often misunderstood. It does not mean without guilt’ but rather a freedom and a total openness to life, a complete lack of fear that comes through a total faith in living and in your own instinctive self. Innocence does not mean ‘asexual’ as some people think. It is sexuality expressed without fear, without guilt, without connivance and dishonesty. It is sexuality expressed spontaneously and freely, as the expression of love and the ecstasy of life. The Fool bears the number 0 because all things are possible to the person who is always ready to go in any direction. He does not belong in any specific place; he is not fixed like the other cards. His innocence makes him a person with no past, and therefore an infinite future. Every moment is a new starting point. In Arabic numerals the number 0 bears the shape of an egg, to indicate that all things emerge from it. Originally the zero was written as a dot; in Hermetic and Qabalistic tradition the universe emerged from a single point of light. And God in the Qabalah is often described as ‘nothingness’ because to describe God as any thing would be to limit Him to some finite fixed state.

Consider two people with the same outer worlds - both successful, respected, wealthy; yet inwardly one may be tense, or frustrated, or afraid, while the other remains joyful and at peace. If we see the Fool as the beginning of the Major Arcana, the King of Pentacles as the final card of the Minor, then the two stand at opposite ends of the Tarot. But this polarity holds true only if we see the cards in a line. If we envision them in a circle, then the Fool and the King of Pentacles become joined together. The King is meant for success. Reversing him suggests failure or simply mediocrity. The lack of fulfilment brings dissatisfac¬ tion, feelings of weakness, and doubt. Taken another way we can see the upside down King as symbolizing the idea of success corrupted, the image of a man or a woman who will use any means to achieve his or her goals. If we describe the King of Pentacles as someone who needs a vital connection with nature (and not everyone does, despite contemporary assumptions), the King reversed stands for the state of being cut off from that rejuvenating Row. Here too the break results in dissatisfaction, weakness, even psychic danger. Where the King sits before a castle the Queen's throne stands entirely in a field, framed by roses. Where the King simply glances at his Pentacle, the Queen holds hers in both hands, intensely aware of the magic in nature and the strength she derives from it.

But we can look at the Fool from another side - the leap into the archetypal world of the trumps. Imagine yourself entering a strange landscape. A world of magicians, of people hanging upside down, and of dancers in the bright air. You can enter through a leap from a height, through a dark cave, a labyrinth, or even by climbing down a rabbit hole chasing a Victorian rabbit with a pocket watch. Whichever way you choose, you are a fool to do it. Why look into the deep world of the mind when you can stay safely in the ordinary landscape of job, home and family? Herman Melville, in Moby Dick , warned his readers not to take even a step outside the ordinary path laid out for you by society. You might not get back again. And yet, for those willing to take the chance, the leap can bring joy, adventure, and finally, for those with the courage to keep going when the wonderland becomes more fearsome than joyous, the leap can bring knowledge, peace, and liberation. Interestingly, the Fool archetype appears more in mythology than in structured religion. An institutionalized Church can hardly urge people beyond the limits of institutions. Instead, the churches offer us a safe haven from the fears of life. Mythology leads directly into the heart of those fears, and in every culture the mythological landscape contains the image of the Trickster - pushing, goading, jabbing the kings and heroes whenever they turn away from the inner world of truth.",

It symbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an end. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression transformed into positive energy. We then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three below the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. (There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying out another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that proved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and approaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The reversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk element of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is also 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It implied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a structure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her friendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming below the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted that while the woman took these risks she must keep an awareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It referred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person she lived with, for there she received total support and should answer this gift with trust.",

Either the person becomes knocked over by people or problems charging her defences, or else the blindfold is given up for the purpose of either seeing truth or communicating. The latter experience can prove very emotional, even shattering if the person does not receive help from outside. The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blind¬ folded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

The image of deepest sorrow, of utmost mental pain. Where the Queen frees herself by turning sorrow into wisdom, and the Three suggests the calm of acceptance, the Nine shows the moment of agony, of dissolution.

The chief meaning is oppression simply, but it is also fortune, gain, any kind of success, and then it is the oppression of these things. It is also a card of false-seeming, disguise, perfidy. The place which the figure is approaching may suffer from the rods that he carries. Success is stultified if the Nine of Swords follows, and if it is a question of a lawsuit, there will be certain loss. Reversed: Contrarieties, difficulties, intrigues, and their analogies.

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

When the Fire finds its goal, the projects and situations come to a satisfactory end. The Wands have come to earth. Therefore, the image on this card implies the addition of Fentacles grounding to Wands energy. Romantically Waite calls them the ‘arrows of love’. We can see this especially as meaning action taken in a love affair, seduction, or proposals made and accepted. Turned around the image becomes one of continuance, of nothing coming to an end, especially when an end is desired. A situation or attitude simply goes on and on, with no conclu¬ sion in sight. If such a situation cannot be avoided, then it is good to recognize it and accept it, rather than let it bring frustration or disappointment. On the other hand, sometimes we ourselves can bring about this up-in-the-air quality by expecting a situation to remain unresolved. One of the most important positions in a reading is that called Topes and fears’; very often it turns out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The arrows of love, when reversed, become arrows of jealousy and argument. The jealousy may derive from uncer¬ tainty and confusion, both in our feelings and in those of the other person. Like the Nine, this is a card of conflict, but here we see the battle itself, and the effect is exhilarating. With their natural strength and positiveness Wands expect to win and usually do. Through active conflict the figure in this card rises above any depression into the clear intoxicating air. In a way this card shows a background to the Nine. We become defensive and committed to fighting through an earlier experience of",

The leaves burst out so abundantly that they fall off to become yods, the first letter of God’s name. The yods’ presence in all the Aces but that of Pentacles indicates that we receive these primal experiences as a gift from life. We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of ele¬ mental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength. At the same time, the card teaches humility, for it reminds us that ultimately we have done nothing morally to deserve the optimism and greater energy that sometimes allows us to overwhelm other people. A reversed Ace implies in some way a failure of that primal experience. This can mean simply that the situation turns against us, or, especially with Wands and Swords, that we find it impossible to hang on to that force and use it beneficially. Therefore, the Ace of Wands reversed can mean chaos, things falling apart, either because it just happened that way, or because we have ruined them through too much undirected energy. This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without con¬ solidating past gains; or emotionally, through being over¬ confident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite. Waite included a much lighter reading for the reversed Ace: ‘Clouded joy’. Then the Ace becomes",

The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential. Nevertheless, the special quality of this Gate, that of exploring the unknown, belongs to Fire. Several meanings reflect the complex nature of the card right side up. On the one hand it can mean the failure of some ‘exploration' or project (either practical or emotional) due to ‘storms’, that is, problems greater than we had hoped for or expected. But it can also mean becoming involved in our environment after a time of detachment and reflection. The image right side up carries a certain isolation as he looks down at the world.

Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

The attitude shown in the card right side up cannot be faked, for when it does not work it becomes the opposite: defeatism, a sense that enemies will overwhelm us, or that life or specific people will betray us in some way. This attitude too often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, for suspicion can produce betrayal. Again conflict, but on a lighter level. It is in the nature of Wands to see life as battle, but in its best sense battle becomes an exciting struggle, eagerly sought after. The Fives in general show some difficulty or loss, but the element of Fire translates problems into competition, seen as a way in which people communicate with society and with each other. The young people are fighting, but not to hurt each other. Like children playing knights they bang their sticks together without really hitting anyone. They seek not to destroy but only to compete for the sheer joy of action. The exciting competition right side up implies a sense of rules and fair play, for without understood agreements struggle as a game becomes impossible. Reversed, the card indicates that the rules are being abandoned, that in fact the battle has taken on a more serious, a nastier tone. The sense of play changes to bitterness or disillusionment as people seek actually to hurt or ruin each other. The Fire attitude to life, especially when not extended by Swords awareness and wisdom, demands that life respond in a positive way and not show its crueller side. The Five reversed brings to mind again that phrase 'the fire has gone out’. The number four, with its image of the square, implies stasis",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea.

As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

                "text": "Notice in this last example that the Two of Cups reversed might be a fear, but it might also be a hope. We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duality of Hopes and Fears shows up most strongly in cards dealing with change, or the emergence from confined situations to open ones. Death, the Eight of Cups, the Two of Wands reversed, and the Four of Wands all deal with these themes of freedom and change. Some others are the Devil reversed, the Eight of Swords reversed, and the Star. Very often if the subject and the reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of these images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence will emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. Because the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or success), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains hidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this ambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or she really wants. Seeing this duality at work in one reading after another teaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning.

The next card was in some ways the most important, as well as the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the Environment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ ticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its importance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical support she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ tant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. The Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of charity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The people around her give her strength simply from being with her, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. Notice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here the women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering or coddling. The Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the Three of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding influences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the hilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. Even though looking back on her life, and exploring new areas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw courage from the people around her. In the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more fearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, collapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's fears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. This fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without immediate success to reassure and encourage her.",

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this fashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its probable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. In the position of Outcome lay the Hermit.

The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth. Pentacles/Earth stand for nature, money, work, routine activities, stable relationships, business in the sense of things made and sold. Also, because Pentacles are magic signs, they stand for the magic of nature and the wonder of ordinary life, not always perceived, but often hidden under the surface.",

                "text": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art.

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

It is worth repeating here the original example which suggested the symbolism of crossed time. The reading was done for a man unsure of the direction of his life. A long love affair was ending, his chosen career as a professional singer had not materialized. The reading began with the High Priestess crossed by the Hiero¬ phant. Now these cards, sometimes called the Papess and the Pope, at first glance represent contradictory values. The High Priestess stands for instinct, mystery, stillness, while the Hierophant, as the preacher of a doctrine by which people may guide their lives, stands for orthodoxy, planned behaviour, clarity. Therefore, it appeared that the two sym¬ bolized conflicting approaches to life. The more I looked at them, however, with their religious imagery, the more I thought of conjunctions, rather than opposites. The two seemed to prescribe almost a way of dealing with life. The High Priestess indicated that within himself this man carried qualities of instinct and understanding that might never fully emerge but could give his life substance. The Hierophant, on the other hand, showed that in his daily life he needed a more rational plan of action; he needed to organize and make definite decisions to achieve what he wanted. But these plans and practical steps would work best if backed by his own instincts and inner awareness rather than by socially- acceptable ideas of proper goals and behaviour. Just as I was trying to explain how these qualities could complement each other the man broke in to say how he saw them as constantly",

Four rams, symbols of Aries, adorn his throne while at the crown’s peak he bears the sign of Aries (unfortunately resembling a propellor). Now, Aries symbolizes force, aggression and war, but as the first sign of the zodiac it also signifies the new life of spring, which can emerge from the stability of a just society. As the middle card of the first line of the Major Arcana the Emperor represents a crucial test. In the process of growing up it is indeed the rules of society that many people find most difficult to surmount. We must absorb these rules, as well as our society’s traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude ‘rules are made to be broken’. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly. Because of the father’s role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mother’s, rather than their own, passions and sensuality.

This is very often the father, but it can also be a husband or lover, especially for those people who treat their lovers as substitute fathers to whom they surrender control of their lives. I have seen readings so dominated by the Emperor that all of life’s possibilities become stunted and unfulfilled. Like the Empress reversed, the Emperor, when upside down, receives those elements complementary to his qualities when he is the right way up. He is, in Waite’s terms, ‘benevolence and compassion’; new life in a stony desert. But the pendulum can swing too far. The reversed Emperor can signify immaturity, and the inability to make harsh decisions and carry them through.",

But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world ‘married’ to nature. He symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them. In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddess’s representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. We see this drama (much like Freud’s substitution of super-ego for id) in many myths; such as Marduk, national hero of Babylon, killing Tiamat, the original mother of creation, because she is giving birth to monsters. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature. In Rome, the concept of law versus chaos was carried to the point where stability, or ‘law and order’ to use the modern term, became virtues in themselves, apart from the inherent morality of those laws. No progress can be made in conditions of anarchy (runs the argument); bad laws need to be changed, but first the law must be obeyed at all costs. Any other approach can only destroy society. Today, we see this viewpoint embodied in an abstraction we call the ‘system’. The Romans saw it more concretely in the personal figure of the Emperor,",

The Emperor symbolized the rules themselves and their official enforcers; the Hierophant indicates our own inner sense of obedience. Reversed, the card means unorthodoxy, especially mental - forming original ideas. It can also, however, mean gullibility and this idea suggests another virtue of the card when it is the right way up. A society builds its intellectual tradition over hundreds of years. Those who accept that tradition receive from it a standard by which to judge new ideas and information. Those who reject it must find their own ways and can easily get lost in superficial ideas. There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way. Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall.",

                "text": "structure arises mainly from Waite and his followers. The picture on the right at the start of this section, from Paul Foster Case’s Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) deck drawn by Jessie Burns Parke, illustrates another tradition. Here the Emperor symbolizes the sum total of spiritual knowledge. He is drawn in profile (this is much more common than the Rider pack full face image), linking them to the Qabalist image for God as the ‘Ancient of Days’, a seated king in profile. (The Ancient’s face was never visible, only his crown with a radiance beneath.) The Emperor’s arms and legs form an equilateral triangle over a cross, the alchemical sign for fire. This figure is later reversed (in Waite as well as Case) in the Hanged Man. As mentioned above, the crossed legs are an esoteric sign, found also on the card of the World. The BOTA Emperor sits on a cube rather than a throne. Also an esoteric symbol, the cube symbolizes both the world and the Tarot itself, as well as the Hebrew alphabet and the paths of the Tree of Life. The symbolism arises from the fact that a cube contains twelve edges, six faces, three axes, and of course a centre, adding up to twenty-two, the number of trumps, Hebrew letters, and paths. And because the Tree of Life is held to represent all creation the cube symbolizes the universe. In readings the Emperor indicates (following the Rider pack image) the power of society, its laws and especially its authority to enforce those laws. The appearance of the trump indicates an encounter with the law. Again, the good or bad qualities depend on the context.",

He is a crowned monarch--commanding, stately, seated on a throne, the arms of which axe fronted by rams' heads. He is executive and realization, the power of this world, here clothed with the highest of its natural attributes. He is occasionally represented as seated on a cubic stone, which, however, confuses some of the issues. He is the virile power, to which the Empress responds, and in this sense is he who seeks to remove the Veil of Isis; yet she remains virgo intacta. It should be understood that this card and that of the Empress do not precisely represent the condition of married life, though this state is implied. On the surface, as I have indicated, they stand for mundane royalty, uplifted on the seats of the mighty; but above this there is the suggestion of another presence. They signify also--and the male figure especially--the higher kingship, occupying the intellectual throne. Hereof is the lordship of thought rather than of the animal world. Both personalities, after their own manner, are \"full of strange experience,\" but theirs is not consciously the wisdom which draws from a higher world. The Emperor has been described as (a) will in its embodied form, but this is only one of its applications, and (b) as an expression of virtualities contained in the Absolute Being--but this is fantasy.

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

This is the colportage interpretation, and it has the same correspondence with the real symbolical meaning that the use of the Tarot in fortune-telling has with its mystic construction according to the secret science of symbolism. I should add that many independent students of the subject, following their own lights, have produced individual sequences of meaning in respect of the Trumps Major, and their lights are sometimes suggestive, but they are not the true lights. For example, Eliphas Levi says that the Magus signifies that unity which is the mother of numbers; others say that it is the Divine Unity; and one of the latest French commentators considers that in its general sense it is the will. 2. The High Priestess, the Pope Joan, or Female Pontiff; early expositors have sought to term this card the Mother, or Pope's Wife, which is opposed to the symbolism. It is sometimes held to represent the Divine Law and the Gnosis, in which case the Priestess corresponds to the idea of the Shekinah. She is the Secret Tradition and the higher sense of the instituted Mysteries. 3. The Empress, who is sometimes represented with full face, while her correspondence, the Emperor, is in profile. As there has been some tendency to ascribe a symbolical significance to this distinction, it seems desirable to say that it carries no inner meaning. The Empress has been connected with the ideas of universal fecundity and in a general sense with activity.",

                "text": "There are two basic variants here. First, all the emotion turns against itself. Some highly-charged situation, usually romantic or domestic, has gone wrong, producing violent feeling, anger, or deceit. Or, in practice, the reversed Ten can simply mean that a person does not recognize or appreciate the happiness life is offering him or her. From deep joy we move to the simpler pleasures of feasting and physical contentment. As noted earlier, the Nines depict the compromises we make with life. Wands showed a strong defence; the more benign Cups demonstrate the attitude of avoiding worry and problems by concentrating on ordinary pleasures. People sometimes react antagonistically to this card, perhaps wishing to see themselves as beyond super¬ ficiality. At times, especially after troubles or a period of long, hard work, nothing can serve us better than a simple good time. For once the reversed meaning gives the greater awareness - to use Waite’s formula, ‘truth, loyalty, liberty'. In connection with the right side up meaning, the words imply a rejection of surface values; but they also refer to very tangled or oppressive situations where, by clinging to the thread of truth, or by staying loyal to ourselves, or to others, or to a purpose, we can bring about victory and liberation. The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has",

                "text": "In other situations, if the Page refers to psychic develop¬ ment, or true visions, then reversed shows a person disturbed by these visions. For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

                "text": "to study the suits as a whole is to see the advantages and problems of each approach. For each suit we will look at a ‘problem’ and a ‘Way to Spirit'. As an example, the problem for Cups is passivity, the Way to Spirit is love. Through the different images we see how the Cups experiences bring out these qualities. In arranging the cards I have followed Waite's example in moving from the King down to the Ace, rather than the other way round. Because kings (as traditional symbols rather than political reality) bear a responsibility for maintaining society, and because the king gives an image of maturity, the four Kings all symbolize the most socially-minded stable version of the suit. The Aces, on the other hand, signify unity and perfec¬ tion. Therefore, the Aces stand for the elements in their purest form. The Ace of Wands stands for Fire itself and all that it means, while the other thirteen Wands cards depict some specific example of Fire, either in a situation (cards 2 - 10) or as a personality type (the court cards). In the Rider pack we see each Ace held in a hand coming out of a cloud. This symbol, seen also in other decks, teaches us that each element can lead us to spiritual mystery. It also teaches us that all experience is a gift, from a source we cannot consciously know, unless we follow the deep spiritual journey showm in the Major Arcana. For this reason I have ended each suit with the Ace.",

However much our egos insist upon our separation from the rest of life, our instincts - the YVater side of us - remind us of our harmonv with the universe. Western culture has emphasized the idea of the individual as unique and separated from the world. The Tarot does not deny the individual’s uniqueness - it insists on it, through the uniqueness of readings - but instead describes the individual as a combination of elements (an astrology chart, with its twelve signs and twelve houses, teaches the same lesson). And one of those elements remains a person's basic- connection to the rest of life. The suit of Cups shows an inner experience that flows rather than defines, that opens rather than restricts. Cups represent love and imagination, joy and peace, a sense of harmony and wonder. They show us love as the Way to Spirit, both the love we give to others and the love we receive from people and from life itself in its happier moments. At times when life demands action, either physical or emotional, Cups represent the problem of passivity. All attempts to do anything, or to sort through some complicated problem, dissolve into vagueness, apathy, or empty dreams. Wands energize Cups, Swords define that emotional energy and give it direction, help it to figure things out (though an Air- storm will agitate the peaceful Water), while Pentacles bring the fantasies back to the ground of real projects.",

We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or Air or Earth experience. We study them together in readings to learn how life in reality embraces and combines all the elements together. As a brief summary, Wands/Fire stand for action, move¬ ment, optimism, adventure, struggle, business in the sense of the activity of commerce rather than the things sold, beginnings. Cups/Water stand for reflection, quiet experi¬ ences, love, friendship, joy, fantasy, passivity. Swords/Air stand for conflict, angry or disturbed emotions, sadness, but also for mental activity, wisdom, the use of intellect to under¬ stand the truth.

Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it.

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

                "text": "The last two positions in the line again feature the idea of combination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

The reading began with the Three of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ bination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the situation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could work it out. The first line then began very positively with the Ace of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly optimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of Pentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also carries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ tions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related much to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ around themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in fact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). The Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman hoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since the Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of Cups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had begun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of security. The Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, the Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, showed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the Tower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering emotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure relationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of jealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ ticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as",

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing. One of the most difficult cards, and one of the reasons why some people find the Rider pack too negative. And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humilia¬ tion as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case. The painful quality remains, though the emphasis may shift. Where right side up indicates the moment of defeat, reversed extends this to the despair felt afterwards. It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those sym¬ bolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more",

At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth. Right side up the King walks a narrow line between commit¬ ted intellect and power for its own sake. Reversed, he tends to fall on the wrong side of that line. He is authority corrupted, strength used for its own ends of power and dominance. In readings, we must always take such strong imagery into consideration. The reversed King (or any reversed court card) may simply mean some person in difficulty. In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relation¬ ship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

The Four of Pentacles, for example, shows the image of a miser, someone ‘cleaving’ to the ‘surety of possessions'. But is it coincidence or plan that these four pentacles cover the crown of the head, the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet, thereby leading to deeper interpretations than simple greed? And in many cases, the picture touches something in us beyond the meaning officially connected to it. Look at the Six of Swords, supposedly a ‘journey by water'. The dream¬ like silence, the sadness implicit in the picture suggest the mythical journey of dead souls across the River Styx. I do not mean to describe Waite as bland, or insensitive to the pictures in his own deck. Sometimes his comments, especially on the pictures, increase our understanding beyond the simple list of meanings. In that Six of Swords he observes that ‘the freight is light’, and this, along with Eden Gray’s comment, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’, leads us to contemplate the image of a spiritual or emotional journey in which we carry our memories and sorrows with us. In the Two of Wands Waite gives two opposed meanings and then says that the picture ‘gives a clue' to their resolution. At other times, however, the meaning given contradicts the picture, as in the Two of Swords, where a powerful image of isolation and defence supposedly illustrates ‘friendship'.",

We see a person tied up, surrounded by swords with a castle - symbol of authority - behind her; she stands in the mud, an image of humiliation and shame. Notice, however, that the swords do not actually fence her in, and the ropes do not go around her legs, while the people who have tied her up do not appear at all in the card. In short, nothing prevents her from just leaving. The clue to this card is the blindfold - symbolizing confu¬ sion, oppressive ideas, isolation from other people in similar situations; what political liberationists call ''mystification' - keeping people down not by direct force, but by training them to believe in their own helplessness. In that remarkable way the Tarot has of summing up a complex situation the card can almost stand as a diagram of the oppressed condition. On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept. Without enlightenment, or what some Sufis and others call ‘conscious evolution', we can never really know ourselves or the world, can never say ‘This is the truth; this is the way things really are'. Recognition of ignorance is the first Freedom begins when we throw' off our blindfolds, when we see clearly how we have arrived in whatever situation we are in, what we have done, what others have done (particularly those who have bound us, but also others in similar situa¬ tions), and what we can do about it now.

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help. Going a step further, this card can indicate craftiness, but with the flaw of habitually hiding, often for no real reason, one's true plans or intentions. The isolation turns around to become communication, in par¬ ticular seeking advice on what to do about one's problems. Valuable as the specific instructions can be, just as important is the person’s readiness to listen and to seek help. The card can sometimes refer to the act of finding help, such as consult¬ ing a reader or a therapist or simply friends. Like all else the value of the image depends on context. Where self-reliance is required the Seven of Swords reversed can imply an overdependence on others telling us what to do. When the card reversed appears in opposition to the Fool or the Hanged Man, we must look to the other cards to deter¬ mine which course - independence or seeking advice — will produce the best results.

She may have given up a sheltered childlike attitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited expectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? I’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to make my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ When opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, making it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ conscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. Why did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the possibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious hope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ servative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ tion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self knows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental protection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can easily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring a return to safety. To become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way towards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a great deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the times we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find when we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea dispels it from our mind.

In other words, the Basis did not come first and then give way to the Recent Past, but, like the small cross, the Recent Past came out of the general pattern shown by the Basis. Now, the Nine of Swords indicates sorrow, grief. It can at times sym¬ bolize mourning. In this case we can think of ‘mourning' as a metaphor. The person she grieves for is herself, for w'e have seen in the Basis that something has ‘died’. That something was not harmful, it had simply lost meaning. However, the fact that her life had gone beyond it did not stop her from missing the safe and comfortable ways of dealing with the world. Nor does the card really suggest that she misses her old self because she fears life. The sadness here is more genuine and, in fact, coexisted with the equally real joy and excitement I had seen before the reading. The first four cards have stressed her inner life; the next two showed the Tarot's ability to indicate trends and events, and in particular to give a warning. First the Possible Outcome. The Five of Swords reversed indicates defeat, producing shame and humiliation. Its presence here showed that despite all that the woman had accomplished her efforts might still come to nothing. Now, sometimes the Outcome card will clearly contradict the Possible Outcome, showing that for some reason the possibility will not become reality. Here the relationship is more subtle. The Hermit is a good indicator that she will not lose what she has gained, but it does not guarantee anything. It shows her headed in a good direction, but not yet arriving, at",

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring. If we look at the card as signifying the self, then reversed indicates a split between what we do and what we feel, between action and emotion. From the King’s conflicting emotions, through the various balances of celebration and passivity, we arrive Anally at the Ace - emblem of love underpinning life. The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value.",

It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment. With the Seven, the Cups problem emerges in its most direct form. Emotion and imagination can produce wonderful visions, but without a grounding in both action and the outer realities of life these fantastic images remain daydreams, ‘fancies’ without real meaning or value. Notice that the visions cover the whole range of fantasies from wealth (the jewels), to a victory wreath, to fear (the dragon), to adventure (the castle), even the archetypes of mythology — a godlike face, a mysterious radiant figure, and a snake, universal symbol of psychic wisdom. It is a mistake to think that daydreams are meaningless because of their content; on the contrary they often spring from deep archetypal needs and images. They lack meaning because they do not connect to anything outside themselves. This card reversed means a determination to make something from dreams. This does not mean rejecting fantasies, but rather doing something with them.",

But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.

                "text": "The stars on the card are all eight pointed which is another reference to Strength. Since an eight pointed star can be formed by placing one square over another with the points alternating, the octogram is sometimes thought of as halfway between the square and the circle. The square stands for matter and the circle for spirit. Human beings are the link between the spirit and the physical world; our ability to both feel the truth, and to act, makes us vehicles through which the truth can manifest itself. The Church used to describe humans as halfway between the animals and the angels. Usually a moral interpretation was given; people could follow their desires or their reason. But we can use this metaphor to say that human awareness and action connect the physical world to the ‘angels’. Despite all the suggestions of manifestations the Star is not really a card of action, but of inner calm. In contrast to Temperance and the Moon, the Star shows no road leading back from the pool to the mountains of outer reality. Though the streams and the ibis imply the uses of creative energy, the experience of the Star is one of peace. For the moment, the journey can wait. In divinatory readings the card expresses hope, a sense of healing and wholeness, especially after emotional storms. Very often the Star and the Tower suggest each other even when only one actually appears. Trump 17 indicates the unconscious activated, but in a very benign way. Reversed, we close ourselves off from the card’s calm and hope, experiencing weakness, impotence, and fear. This deep insecurity can sometimes mask itself as arrogance. If the Star indicates the human as a link between the spirit and the outer world then the card reversed symbolizes the channels",

More likely you will experience it as a fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same time of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either way, it is difficult to describe in words these intense experiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal meaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, what we do with those images comes out of our own needs and experiences. Various people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph D’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot meditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions do not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of becoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience different things in these moments. For instance, with Strength you might find yourself running with the lion, or else the woman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you might become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as happened to me once, the woman might release the lion to leap at you and claw and bite you. Here are some more hints. If you do not have a particular image you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply go through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into it. Then place it before you and begin with your normal meditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any ideas you might have about it.

In these situations I read the Possible Outcome as something that might have happened but will not. The task then is to look at the other cards for the reason why the outcome should happen instead. Suppose the Star lies in the person’s Possible Outcome, indicating that the person might emerge feeling very free, full of hope, open to life. Suppose then that the Devil comes up as the actual Outcome, indicating bondage to an oppressive situation. What has gone wrong? If, say, the Nine of Swords reversed lies in the position of Basis, this would give us a clue, for it would say that the person holds inside her or him a sense of shame and humiliation coming from past weaknesses and fears, and that the ‘imprisonment’ symbolized in the Nine prevents the person from realizing the potential of the Star. These examples will help us to see that the true meaning of a Tarot reading does not come from specific cards but rather from the configurations they form together.",

We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to success, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet the Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the relationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the Three of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ break has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At other times, a very positive card in this position, such as the Star or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would indicate that the person’s attitude can create success. Sometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work very closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of the subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of Cups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of Wands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a background of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude towards the continuance of the love affair.",

As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond the Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the reading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will develop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s reaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the person’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. For instance, it can indicate an event or further development that comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups followed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses something, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, the person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new phase in life. Or, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ chologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the Star, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would lead to a release of hope and energy. This example also illustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the Outcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed only the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would leave the subject with a sense of devastation. Very often the first line will give such a strong picture that the person will need no further information. At other times, however, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or simply wishing to see the situation from a different point of view. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another line directly under the first. The positions remain the same, and the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that set out the basic situation. And yet, because we",

Following Crowley and others, several contemporary books have attempted to widen the meaning of the cards by linking them not only to astrology and the Qabalah but to the 1 Ching, Jungian psychology, Tantra, even Central American mythology. Such linking aids understanding, particularly for those people with a previous knowledge of the other system (it would be interesting to see a book about, say, gestalt psy¬ chology which explains its subject in terms of Tarot correspondence rather than the other way round). Still, the emphasis for any careful study of Tarot must remain with the cards themselves, and with their use in meditation and in readings. This section of the book hopes to give at least a sense of just how complex and deeply instructive a tool Tarot divination can be. Many people say that Tarot readings ‘scare’ them. What they mean by this is first a discomfort that anything should expose their experiences, as well as their inner fears and their hopes; and second, that a pack of cards should do so. They may approach the Tarot first as a game, especially if a friend or relative lays the cards so that they do not have to pay for the reading. They mix the cards, grinning a little, for they feel foolish; the reader lays them out, perhaps looking up the meanings in a book, and amazingly, out comes the new job, or the unfaithful lover or, if the reader approaches it a little more subtly, perhaps the fear of illness or a painful rebellion against a parent. ‘You’re making that up from what you know about me,’ they say, or ‘You could tell all that from looking at me, couldn’t you? You didn’t really get that from the cards.'",

If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth. In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life. But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge.",

Using the Tarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very tricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, usually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other systems. I have found it better to get a more general picture from the line, looking not just at physical condition but also emotional, spiritual health. One recommendation - observe which elements dominate. Strong Wands suggest good general health through the person’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie Nine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. Cups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual condition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker health or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for instance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of Major cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ ding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, would indicate good general health, Temperance would indicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- sickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can symbolize some special situation that has appeared or will appear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in the whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the beginning reader. The third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly the imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked at the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and awareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made conscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ tions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle level - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link between the two.",

We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot.

Of course, most astrologers say that the sun sign constitutes only one twelfth of the person’s chart",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative.

                "text": "Briefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came from being a member of a minority group, with experiences not shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was alone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the people around her she allowed herself to hide her own experiences in an attempt to blend in. The three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death reversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every card so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as Eight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed the need for change. The King described an attitude to take towards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ fusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a danger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up became emphasized when we compared it with the Six of Swords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the journey of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ tion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her journey by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had accustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ tion.

                "text": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant’. The Queen represents the yin, or receptive qualities of each element. She shows an appreciation of that element rather than the King’s social use of it. '1'his does not mean that the Queens indicate weakness, or even inaction, but rather the element translated into feeling and understanding.",

                "text": "From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

For many people in our rationalized world the sudden emergence of psychic talent, even if deliberately sought through training, can appear very frightening. The reversed Page mirrors the fear and reminds us to calm down, to look peacefully at the fish rising from the cup of ourselves. In connection with Pentacles it calls for grounding in outer reality to avoid being washed away by fantasies or visions. As the highest number, the Tens signify being filled with the quality of the suit. In Wands we saw an excess of burdens; in Cups we find joy and the wonder of life spread across the sky. The holy Grail, symbol of God's grace and love, rests at the base of this suit, showing us that love, imagination, and joy all come to us as gifts. The Bible tells us that God made the rainbow as a promise that the world will never again suffer a Hood of destruction. But the rainbow carries a more positive promise as well - that life brings happiness and not just an absence of pain. The man and woman in the picture understand these things. Arm in arm they look up and celebrate the rainbow. The children, however, dance without looking up. They sym¬ bolize innocence, which takes happiness as the natural condi¬ tion of life. They expect happiness, but do not waste it. Showing a family, the card refers primarily to domestic happiness, but can indicate any situation that brings a surge of joy. It especially refers to the recognition of the valuable qualities in a situation. This meaning pertains especially in readings where the Ten of Cups appears in contrast to the",

Where the Knight is the prototypical worker the Page represents the student, lost in his studies, fascinated, feeling little concern for anything outside them. Nevertheless he partakes of the suit's practical nature by symbolizing the actual work of the student, the study and scholarship, as compared to the inspiration sym¬ bolized by the Page of Cups. The student here acts as a symbol; the Page need not refer to someone actually in school, but simply anyone approaching any activity with those qualities of fascination, of involvement, of caring less for rewards or social position than for the work itself. Again the Page appears as the converse of the Knight. In reality the two of them split the Pentacles double qualities - practicality and magic. Where the Knight, without his job, becomes discouraged and inert, the Page, without his sense of hard work, gives way to wildness and dissipation, what Waite calls ‘prodigality'.

In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

At the same time, as a Minor figure she carries a quality lacking in the archetypal trump of passion: self-awareness. She knows and believes in herself, and in the magic of her life. In readings, this quality of. seif-trust will often prove the most important. If the King stands beside the Fool then the Queen belongs with the Magician. Like him she wears a red robe over a white shirt; leaves and flowers frame both of them; a yellow sky shines behind each. Where the Magician manipulates the forces hidden in the world, the Queen of Pentacles joins herself to those forces, allowing them to flow through her into her daily life. In readings, the Queen reversed can mean not trusting oneself in some specific situation. More generally it refers to psychic weakness. For cutting off the Queen from her vital connection to the earth results, even more so than with the King, in nervousness and confusion. She becomes afraid, even phobic, mistrustful of others and especially of herself, doubting her abilities and her value as a person. This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work. The Knight's responsibility for action brings",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

We can go further and say that doing Tarot readings helps achieve a balance and unity of these principles in their practical states, that of will and openness. Each time we do a reading we assert our will to impose a meaning on the patterns thrown out by chaos. The act suggests not only the Magician (number 1) but the Wheel of Fortune (number 10). The latter card carries a vision of the world in time (remember the Wirth version of the Wheel as resting in a boat - consciousness - floating on the sea of existence). However, meaning imposed by consciousness carries true value only if we open ourselves to the pictures and the impact they make on us. Therefore, Tarot readings suggest the High Priestess (number 2), but also the Hanged Man (number 12), the image of such a close connection to life that we no longer see ourselves as separate or opposed to it. And the card that connects trumps 10 and 12 can also stand for the emblem of Tarot readings themselves: Justice, her scales forever balanced not by a careful weighing of opposites - so much intuition for so much objective knowledge - but by a living commitment to the truth. Chinese people Pentacles, most Swedes Wands, and so on. A more objective system uses astrological signs. As described earlier, the four elements signify signs of the zodiac, as well as the suits of Tarot.

                "text": "Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics. Here the energy becomes released. The act can signify generosity and freedom - if right side up indicates greed or confinement within ourselves - but it can also represent the inability to hold our life together, to give it structure. Once again, in an actual situation the meaning depends on other influences. We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery.",

Together the three figures signify that the best w'ork combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development. Fart of this card's meaning lies in the fact that such sym¬ bolism of psychic development should occur in mundane Pentacles, rather than the often more exotic images of the other suits. Mediocrity: the work, physical or spiritual, goes badly, often from laziness or weakness. Sometimes the meaning extends to a general situation in which little happens; things continue, either getting worse or improving, at a slow steady rate. Like the Two of Swords the Two of Pentacles strikes a pre¬ carious balance, though in general a happier one. We see, in fact, the very concept of balance in the image of the juggler. At times the card means juggling life itself, keeping everything in the air at once. More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast.",

We cannot understand this paradox immediately. We need to ponder and experience it. Two facts about Pentacles/Earth will hint at its true value. First, in a study of religious leaders, ancient and modern, the astrologer Ronnie Dreyer has found that Earth signs predominate throughout their charts. Second, Pentacles contains more Gate cards than any other suit. The mundaneness of Pentacles goes very well with the social responsibility of the King, who presents to us the very image of the successful business or professional man. The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorat¬ ing his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it.

Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self- awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this sym¬ bolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals.",

The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can sym¬ bolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become indepen¬ dent of our parents. At other times, however, the Ace reversed can mean recognizing (as with the Eight of Cups) that the time has come to leave the familiar behind and travel through the Gate to the mountains of wisdom. The use of Tarot cards for doing readings - ‘divination’, to give the practice its proper name - has been controversial for at least as long as the occult, ‘serious’ study of the cards began in the eighteenth century. Paradoxically, while many occultists will sneer at divination, most people know of no other purpose for Tarot. Fairly early in their history, Tarot cards came into the hands of the Romany, or ‘gypsies', probably when they entered Spain from North Africa (the cards apparently came to Spain from Italy or France). The Romany have given us no information on any private or secret use they might have made of the cards. Publicly, of course, they used them to make money telling fortunes - for the rich in private chambers where no one could learn their secrets, for",

Divinatory Meanings: Perfect contentment, felicity, ecstasy; also speedy intelligence; gold. Reversed: The evil side of wealth, bad intelligence; also great riches. In any case it shews prosperity, comfortable material conditions, but whether these are of advantage to the possessor will depend on whether the card is reversed or not.

                "text": "The image in Fig. 48(b), slightly different from the official Rider version (Fig. 48(a)), comes from an American edition of several years ago. In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right- hand side. Clearly she is turning aw'ay from the sun. The sym¬ bolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline. And an entry through the Gate of this card will help bring one to the joy of true discipline, which does not cripple, but soars. The qualities of the card become denied or turned around: lack of discipline and the failure that comes from it; projects taken up and then abandoned; an inability to channel energy into useful purposes. It can mean not knowing what w'e want, or what really matters to us. The lack of self-awareness brings irresponsibility and faithlessness, to others as well as our¬ selves. The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill.",

Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply some¬ thing beyond their literal meaning. Most people will uncon¬ sciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order con¬ sciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person.

In general the Seven reversed shows the pervasive dissatisfaction, the trapped feeling, that comes from unsatisfying jobs or com¬ mitments. Again, the Seven reversed can mean any specific dissatisfaction or anxiety, in particular one arising from some project that is not going well. The next two cards, related by their symbolism, stand among the most complex cards of the Minor Arcana, indeed of the whole deck. At the same time they demonstrate the difference between layers of interpretation and that extra dimension I call the Gate; for while the Five allows quite a few meanings the Six shows us the Gate mechanism itself. On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfort¬ able; or",

The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts. The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Some¬ times this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrup¬ ted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives. The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions.",

There is scarcely any canon of criticism in matters of this kind. I suppose that in proportion as any system descends from generalities to details it becomes naturally the more precarious; and in the records of professional fortune-telling, it offers more of the dregs and lees of the subject. At the same time, divinations based on intuition and second sight are of little practical value unless they come down from the region of universals to that of particulars; but in proportion as this gift is present in a particular case, the specific meanings recorded by past cartomancists will be disregarded in favour of the personal appreciation of card values.

He is drawn in profile (this is much more common than the Rider pack full face image), linking them to the Qabalist image for God as the ‘Ancient of Days’, a seated king in profile. (The Ancient’s face was ...\n\n[4] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.70)\nthese two), where he urges us on despite our fears. In the Minor Arcana the Fool relates first of all to Wands - action, eagerness, movement without thought. But it connects as well to Cups, with their emphasis on imagination and instinct. The Fool, in fact, combines these two suits. Later we will see that this combination, fire and water, represents the way of transformation. Finally the question arises of the Fool’s place in divinatory readings. I have already mentioned the importance of readi...\n\n[5] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.70)\nwill give these further indications regarding the Fool, which is the most speaking of all the symbols. He signifies the journey outward, the state of the first emanation, the graces and passivity of the spirit.

The cards showed the journey and its hoped for end. For the top corners we used the Eight of Swords reversed and the King of Wands reversed - the desired action and the attitude needed to produce it. Finally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups below the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed below the Six of Swords. The ...\n\n[7] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.70)\nIn astrology and Jungian thought the elements stand for types and characteristics. In the Tarot we see these types reflected in the court cards. The suits as a whole show- activities and qualities of life rather than individual psy¬ chology. In other words, if Wands dominate in a reading we do not say that the person is a 'fiery' character, but rather that she or he is currently going through many Fire experiences. We study the four suits separately to learn just what we mean by Fire or Water or...\n\n[8] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.70)\nHe has a form of the Crux ansata for his sceptre and a globe in his left hand.

He is occasionally represented as seated on a cubic stone, which, however, confuses some of the issues.

Divinatory Meanings: The card speaks for itself on the surface, but other readings are entirely antithetical--giving joy, mildness, timidity, honour, modesty. In practice, it is usually found that the card shews the decline of a matter, or that a matter which has been thought to be important is really of slight consequence--either for good or evil. Reversed: Great joy, happiness, feasting...\n\n[10] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.69)\nAnother reversed meaning of the Fool will appear at first to contradict the one just given. Recklessness, wildness, crazy schemes all seem the opposite of over-caution. And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing. This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to t...\n\n[11] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.69)\nA hoodwinked female figure balances two swords upon her shoulders. Divinatory Meanings: Conformity and the equipoise which it suggests, courage, friendship, concord in a state of arms; another reading gives tenderness, affection, intimacy. The suggestion of harmony and other favourable readings must be considered in a qualified manner, as Swords generally are not symbolical of beneficent forces in human affairs. Reversed: Imposture, falsehood, duplicity, disloyalty. The Pictorial Key to the Taro...\n\n[12] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.69)\nDrawing on another well-known symbolic system Wands and Swords represent ‘yang' or ‘active' situations, while Cups and Pentacles stand for ‘yin - or ‘passive' ones. We can also substitute, with reference to the Major Arcana, Magician for yang and High Priestess for yin. Whatever the terminology, these distinctions become clearer in the imagery. Both wands and swords are used for striking; cups, on the other hand, fulfil their function by receiving and holding water; while pentacles, as either ma...\n\n[13] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.69)\nBriefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit reversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality of the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the High Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to use her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ dividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations showed a desire to understand herself and the situation, thereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side of the ...\n\n[14] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.68)\nThe Fool represents true innocence, a kind of perfect state of joy and freedom, a feeling of being one with the spirit of life at all times; in other words, the ‘immortal’ self we feel became entrapped in the confusions and compromises of the ordinary world. Perhaps such a radiant self never really existed. Somehow we experience our intuition of it as something lost.

Some Tarot com¬ mentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of wha...\n\n[18] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.67)\nBecause material gifts exist in a way that the gifts of the other Aces do not, they are more open to abuse. The Ace of Pentacles reversed can signify all the ways in which wealth corrupts people - selfishness, extreme competition, mistrust, overdependence on security and comfort. Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with he...\n\n[19] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.67)\nIn different ways the reversed card shows a breakdown of the ideals symbolized right side up. It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than ...\n\n[20] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.67)\nIn the Tarot we see the four elements as Fire-Wands (Staves), Water-Cups, Air-Swords, Earth-Pentacles (Coins). Different writers sometimes give variations on this listing, most often switching Wands and Fentacles, on the grounds that sticks grow out of the earth, and coins are forged in a fire. I have chosen to stay with the more common listing because of the wider associations of fire and earth.

Sometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important question becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the subject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at the other cards to see what influences are pushing in that direction, with the hope of changing the situation. If the Outcome app...\n\n[31] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nhuman psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person. As a more objective source of informa¬ tion the Tarot can help us understand our own or someone else’s needs. Because of these meanings, the Six of Pentacles relates to the Nine in the context of that card as an emblem of certitude.\n\n[32] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nFire implies swiftness and movement. Though this movement sometimes lacks direction we see here the image of a journey reaching an end, or things completed.

But we can also look at reversals as deepening the meaning of the card as a whole. In general, a reversed card indicates that the qualities of that card have become blocked, distorted or channelled in another direction. For the Fool a reversal means first of all a failure to follow your instincts. It can mean not taking a chance at some crucial time, because of fear or depending too much on plans and the practical advice of others.\n\n[39] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nUsually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulti...\n\n[40] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.66)\nthe everyday world of the Minor Arcana to the world of archetypes. The Fool also helps us jump the gap from one line to the next, that is, from the Chariot to Strength, from Temperance to the Devil. To reach the Chariot or Temperance requires great effort and courage, and without the Fool’s readiness to leap into new territory we would likely stop with what we have already achieved. The Fool belongs as well with those cards of difficult passage, such as the Moon and Death (observe the winding ro...\n\n[41] [pkt.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nThe resources of interpretation have been lavished, if not exhausted, on the twenty-two Trumps Major, the symbolism of which is unquestionable.

If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing.

And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their li...\n\n[43] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nAbove the Environment comes a position similar to Self but one with a sharper focus. We call this position ‘Hopes and Fears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future affect the working out of events. Often this card will almost dominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ rent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems likely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this card can work either for or against the person. Suppose the reading concern...\n\n[44] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nFinally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles sym¬ bolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meetin...\n\n[45] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.65)\nNotice in this last example that the Two of Cups reversed might be a fear, but it might also be a hope. We call the position Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or Fears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go together (something originally pointed out to me by my therapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear success at the same time, while in relationships many people will fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for rejection. The duali...\n\n[46] [78_degrees_of_wisdom.txt] (Similarity: 0.64)\nTrumps 3 and 4 of the Tarot represent the parents in their archetypal roles. But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world ‘married’ to nature.

These things emerge through interpretation of the Tarot's images, through joining ourselves to those images in medita¬ tion, and through seeing the combinations formed in readings. Taken separately, the cards of the Minor Arcana present us with a grand panorama of human experiences.
