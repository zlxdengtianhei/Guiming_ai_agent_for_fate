          "rag_text": "[method_steps] To perform a three-card spread in Tarot divination, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Space**: Find a quiet space where you can focus without distractions.\n\n2. **Set Your Intention**: If you have a specific question, concentrate on it and say it out loud. If not, clear your mind and focus on the Significator.\n\n3. **Shuffle the Cards**: Shuffle the entire deck thoroughly while keeping your mind as blank as possible. This helps to avoid personal bias.\n\n4. **Draw the Cards**: After shuffling, draw three cards from the deck. You can either take them from the top or fan them out and select them intuitively.\n\n5. **Interpret the Cards**: Lay the three cards out in a row. Typically, the first card represents the past, the second the present, and the third the future. Interpret each card based on its position and meaning.\n\n6. **Combine Meanings**: Consider how the cards interact with each other to provide a deeper insight into your question or situation.\n\n7. **Reflect**: Take a moment to reflect on the reading and how it resonates with your current circumstances. \n\nThis method allows for a concise yet insightful reading, providing clarity on the situation at hand.\n\n[position_interpretation] In a three-card spread, the positions typically represent the following:\n\n1. **First Card (Significator)**: This card reflects the current situation or the Querent's present state regarding the question at hand.\n\n2. **Second Card (Crosses Him)**: This card indicates obstacles or challenges that the Querent may face. If it is a favorable card, it suggests that the opposing forces are not serious or that something positive may not yield the expected results.\n\n3. **Third Card (Crowns Him)**: This card symbolizes the Querent's aim or ideal in the matter, representing the best possible outcome under the current circumstances that has not yet been realized. \n\nEach card's meaning can be influenced by its position and the context of the reading.\n\n[psychological_background] In a three-card spread from a psychological perspective, each card can represent different aspects of the querent's psyche or situation:\n\n1. **Past Influences**: The first card reflects past experiences or influences that have shaped the current situation. It may reveal underlying beliefs or emotional patterns that need to be acknowledged.\n\n2. **Present Situation**: The second card represents the current state of mind or circumstances. This card can highlight conscious thoughts, feelings, or challenges that the querent is facing, emphasizing the need for awareness and introspection.\n\n3. **Future Guidance**: The third card offers insight into potential outcomes or advice for moving forward. It encourages the querent to integrate the lessons from the past and present to foster personal growth and transformation.\n\nThis approach aligns with the principles of the Magician (will) and the High Priestess (intuition), promoting a balance between conscious decision-making and intuitive understanding.\n\n[traditional_method] The three-card spread is a traditional Tarot divination method that can be traced back to ancient practices, including Celtic traditions. In this spread, three cards are drawn and typically represent the past, present, and future, providing insight into the Querent's situation. Each card's meaning is interpreted individually, but they can also be read in combination to reveal deeper connections and narratives. This method emphasizes simplicity and clarity, aligning with the belief that straightforward approaches yield the most truthful insights.",

            "rag_text": "[basic_upright_reversed_suit_meaning] The Eight of Swords reversed signifies a desire for self-understanding and liberation from oppressive situations. It reflects a shift from confusion and isolation towards clarity and freedom. In the context of the air element and thought, it suggests overcoming mental barriers and gaining insight into one's circumstances, leading to empowerment and the ability to move forward.\n\n[visual_description] The Eight of Swords depicts a blindfolded woman standing in mud, symbolizing humiliation and shame. She is surrounded by swords, which represent oppression, but they do not physically confine her. The ropes binding her do not restrict her legs, indicating that she has the ability to leave her situation. The presence of a castle in the background symbolizes authority, while the blindfold signifies confusion and isolation from others in similar circumstances. Overall, the imagery conveys a sense of entrapment that is more psychological than physical.\n\n[position_and_psychological_meaning] In the past position, the Eight of Swords suggests a period of feeling trapped and restricted, often due to self-imposed limitations or negative thought patterns. Psychologically, it reflects a sense of confusion and isolation, where the individual may have felt powerless and unable to see a way out of their situation. The blindfold symbolizes a lack of clarity and awareness, indicating that the person may have been unaware of their own ability to change their circumstances. This card highlights the importance of recognizing that the barriers are often mental rather than physical, encouraging a journey towards self-discovery and liberation.",

Swords represent intellect, conflict, and decision-making, while Wands symbolize creativity, action, and passion. This combination suggests a period of dynamic experiences involving both mental challenges and energetic pursuits. However, it may also highlight a potential imbalance if there are fewer Cups (emotional, receptive) and Pentacles (material, grounded) cards, indicating a need to address emotional and practical aspects of life.\n\n[reversed_pattern] In a Tarot spread, a reversed card typically indicates a blockage or distortion of the card's upright meaning. It suggests that the qualities associated with the card are not being fully realized or are being channeled in an unexpected direction. For example, if the Fool is reversed, it may signify a failure to trust one's instincts or a reluctance to take necessary risks due to fear or over-reliance on practical advice. Overall, reversed cards can reveal deeper insights, highlighting challenges, internal conflicts, or the need for reevaluation in the context of the reading.\n\n[card_relationships] In this sequence, the Eight of Swords in the past position indicates a period of feeling trapped or restricted, often due to self-imposed limitations or fears. Moving to the Nine of Wands in the present, this card suggests resilience and perseverance despite challenges; it reflects a readiness to defend one's position and the strength gained from past struggles. Finally, the Seven of Wands in the future position signifies a need to stand your ground and assert yourself against competition or opposition. Together, this sequence illustrates a journey from feeling confined to becoming empowered and ready to face future challenges with confidence.",

If not, clear your mind and focus on the Significator.\n\n3. **Shuffle the Cards**: Shuffle the entire deck thoroughly while keeping your mind as blank as possible. This helps to avoid personal bias.\n\n4. **Draw the Cards**: After shuffling, draw three cards from the deck. You can either take them from the top or fan them out and select them intuitively.\n\n5. **Interpret the Cards**: Lay the three cards out in a row. Typically, the first card represents the past, the second the present, and the third the future. Interpret each card based on its position and meaning.\n\n6. **Combine Meanings**: Consider how the cards interact with each other to provide a deeper insight into your question or situation.\n\n7. **Reflect**: Take a moment to reflect on the reading and how it resonates with your current circumstances. \n\nThis method allows for a concise yet insightful reading, providing clarity on the situation at hand.",

          "rag_text": "[method_steps] To perform a three-card spread in Tarot divination, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Space**: Find a quiet space where you can focus without distractions.\n\n2. **Set Your Intention**: If you have a specific question, concentrate on it and say it out loud. If not, clear your mind and focus on the Significator.\n\n3. **Shuffle the Cards**: Shuffle the entire deck thoroughly while keeping your mind as blank as possible. This helps to avoid personal bias.\n\n4. **Draw the Cards**: After shuffling, draw three cards from the deck. You can either take them from the top or fan them out and select them intuitively.\n\n5. **Interpret the Cards**: Lay the three cards out in a row. Typically, the first card represents the past, the second the present, and the third the future. Interpret each card based on its position and meaning.\n\n6. **Combine Meanings**: Consider how the cards interact with each other to provide a deeper insight into your question or situation.\n\n7. **Reflect**: Take a moment to reflect on the reading and how it resonates with your current circumstances. \n\nThis method allows for a concise yet insightful reading, providing clarity on the situation at hand.\n\n[position_interpretation] In a three-card spread, the positions typically represent the following:\n\n1. **First Card (Significator)**: This card reflects the current situation or the Querent's present state regarding the question at hand.\n\n2. **Second Card (Crosses Him)**: This card indicates obstacles or challenges that the Querent may face. If it is a favorable card, it suggests that the opposing forces are not serious or that something positive may not yield the expected results.\n\n3. **Third Card (Crowns Him)**: This card symbolizes the Querent's aim or ideal in the matter, representing the best possible outcome under the current circumstances that has not yet been realized. \n\nEach card's meaning can be influenced by its position and the context of the reading.\n\n[psychological_background] In a three-card spread from a psychological perspective, each card can represent different aspects of the querent's psyche or situation:\n\n1. **Past Influences**: The first card reflects past experiences or influences that have shaped the current situation. It may reveal underlying beliefs or emotional patterns that need to be acknowledged.\n\n2. **Present Situation**: The second card represents the current state of mind or circumstances. This card can highlight conscious thoughts, feelings, or challenges that the querent is facing, emphasizing the need for awareness and introspection.\n\n3. **Future Guidance**: The third card offers insight into potential outcomes or advice for moving forward. It encourages the querent to integrate the lessons from the past and present to foster personal growth and transformation.\n\nThis approach aligns with the principles of the Magician (will) and the High Priestess (intuition), promoting a balance between conscious decision-making and intuitive understanding.\n\n[traditional_method] The three-card spread is a traditional Tarot divination method that can be traced back to ancient practices, including Celtic traditions. In this spread, three cards are drawn and typically represent the past, present, and future, providing insight into the Querent's situation. Each card's meaning is interpreted individually, but they can also be read in combination to reveal deeper connections and narratives. This method emphasizes simplicity and clarity, aligning with the belief that straightforward approaches yield the most truthful insights.",

It reflects a shift from confusion and isolation towards clarity and freedom. In the context of the air element and thought, it suggests overcoming mental barriers and gaining insight into one's circumstances, leading to empowerment and the ability to move forward.\n\n[visual_description] The Eight of Swords depicts a blindfolded woman standing in mud, symbolizing humiliation and shame. She is surrounded by swords, which represent oppression, but they do not physically confine her. The ropes binding her do not restrict her legs, indicating that she has the ability to leave her situation. The presence of a castle in the background symbolizes authority, while the blindfold signifies confusion and isolation from others in similar circumstances. Overall, the imagery conveys a sense of entrapment that is more psychological than physical.\n\n[position_and_psychological_meaning] In the past position, the Eight of Swords suggests a period of feeling trapped and restricted, often due to self-imposed limitations or negative thought patterns. Psychologically, it reflects a sense of confusion and isolation, where the individual may have felt powerless and unable to see a way out of their situation. The blindfold symbolizes a lack of clarity and awareness, indicating that the person may have been unaware of their own ability to change their circumstances. This card highlights the importance of recognizing that the barriers are often mental rather than physical, encouraging a journey towards self-discovery and liberation.",

It reflects a shift from confusion and isolation towards clarity and freedom. In the context of the air element and thought, it suggests overcoming mental barriers and gaining insight into one's circumstances, leading to empowerment and the ability to move forward.\n\n[visual_description] The Eight of Swords depicts a blindfolded woman standing in mud, symbolizing humiliation and shame. She is surrounded by swords, which represent oppression, but they do not physically confine her. The ropes binding her do not restrict her legs, indicating that she has the ability to leave her situation. The presence of a castle in the background symbolizes authority, while the blindfold signifies confusion and isolation from others in similar circumstances. Overall, the imagery conveys a sense of entrapment that is more psychological than physical.\n\n[position_and_psychological_meaning] In the past position, the Eight of Swords suggests a period of feeling trapped and restricted, often due to self-imposed limitations or negative thought patterns. Psychologically, it reflects a sense of confusion and isolation, where the individual may have felt powerless and unable to see a way out of their situation. The blindfold symbolizes a lack of clarity and awareness, indicating that the person may have been unaware of their own ability to change their circumstances. This card highlights the importance of recognizing that the barriers are often mental rather than physical, encouraging a journey towards self-discovery and liberation.",

It reflects a readiness to continue fighting for one's goals, showcasing both physical and mental alertness. The energy of Fire in this card emphasizes action, courage, and the ability to overcome obstacles, suggesting that success is within reach despite ongoing struggles.\n\n[visual_description] The Nine of Wands typically depicts a strong figure, often muscular and keen-eyed, standing defensively with a bandage or injury, symbolizing resilience after facing opposition.

The overall imagery conveys a sense of strength, determination, and readiness to confront further challenges, embodying the themes of endurance and perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\n[position_and_psychological_meaning] The Nine of Wands represents resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity. Psychologically, it reflects a state of being battle-weary yet determined. The individual has faced significant challenges and opposition, leading to a strengthened sense of self. However, this card also indicates a tendency to become trapped in conflict, suggesting that while one is prepared to defend themselves, they may also be struggling with emotional fatigue and the weight of past struggles.

It reflects a dynamic situation where you must be proactive and resilient, often indicating a struggle that ultimately leads to personal growth and empowerment. The card also hints at the excitement of conflict and the adrenaline that comes with overcoming obstacles.\n\n[visual_description] The Seven of Wands typically depicts a figure standing on a hill or elevated position, holding a wand defensively while facing several other wands pointed towards them from below.

Swords represent intellect, conflict, and decision-making, while Wands symbolize creativity, action, and passion. This combination suggests a period of dynamic experiences involving both mental challenges and energetic pursuits. However, it may also highlight a potential imbalance if there are fewer Cups (emotional, receptive) and Pentacles (material, grounded) cards, indicating a need to address emotional and practical aspects of life.\n\n[reversed_pattern] In a Tarot spread, a reversed card typically indicates a blockage or distortion of the card's upright meaning. It suggests that the qualities associated with the card are not being fully realized or are being channeled in an unexpected direction. For example, if the Fool is reversed, it may signify a failure to trust one's instincts or a reluctance to take necessary risks due to fear or over-reliance on practical advice. Overall, reversed cards can reveal deeper insights, highlighting challenges, internal conflicts, or the need for reevaluation in the context of the reading.\n\n[card_relationships] In this sequence, the Eight of Swords in the past position indicates a period of feeling trapped or restricted, often due to self-imposed limitations or fears. Moving to the Nine of Wands in the present, this card suggests resilience and perseverance despite challenges; it reflects a readiness to defend one's position and the strength gained from past struggles. Finally, the Seven of Wands in the future position signifies a need to stand your ground and assert yourself against competition or opposition. Together, this sequence illustrates a journey from feeling confined to becoming empowered and ready to face future challenges with confidence.\n\n## 解读要求：\n请提供一个全面的塔罗占卜解读，包含：\n1. **整体解读**：2-3句话的整体摘要\n2. **位置解读**：对每个位置进行详细解读，结合卡牌的基本含义和位置的含义\n3. **关系分析**：分析牌之间的关系（时间线、因果、支持/对抗）\n4. **模式解释**：解释数字模式、花色分布、特殊组合的含义\n5. **个性化建议**：基于用户信息和问题，提供具体建议\n\n请用中文输出，使用Markdown格式。",
