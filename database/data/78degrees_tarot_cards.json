    "description": "The Fool e have already looked at the Fool in one aspect, the image of a spirit totally free. But we can look at the Fool from another side - the leap into the archetypal world of the trumps. Imagine yourself entering a strange landscape. A world of magicians, of people hanging upside down, and of dancers in the bright air. You can enter through a leap from a height, THE OPENING TRUMPS through a dark cave, a labyrinth, or even by climbing down a rabbit hole chasing a Victorian rabbit with a pocket watch. Whichever way you choose, you are a fool to do it. Why look into the deep world of the mind when you can stay safely in the ordinary landscape of job, home and family? Herman Melville, in Moby Dick , warned his readers not to take even a step outside the ordinary path laid out for you by society. You might not get back again. And yet, for those willing to take the chance, the leap can bring joy, adventure, and finally, for those with the courage to keep going when the wonderland becomes more fearsome than joyous, the leap can bring knowledge, peace, and liberation. Interestingly, the Fool archetype appears more in mythology than in structured religion. An institutionalized Church can hardly urge people beyond the limits of institutions. Instead, the churches offer us a safe haven from the fears of life. Mythology leads directly into the heart of those fears, and in every culture the mythological landscape contains the image of the Trickster - pushing, goading, jabbing the kings and heroes whenever they turn away from the inner world of truth. In the King Arthur legends Merlin appears not only as a sorcerer and wise man but as a trickster. Constantly he appears before Arthur in disguise, as a child, a beggar, an old peasant. The young king, already seduced into pompousness by his high social position, never recognizes Merlin until his companions point out that he has been tricked again. More important than laws or military strategy is the ability to see through illusions. The Taoist masters-were famous for playing tricks on their disciples. The Fool archetype has even found social expression, as the real court jester. We all know the image from King Lear of ‘the fool’, permitted to tell the king truths no one else would dare to express. Today, our comedians and satirists enjoy something of the same privilege. In many countries a yearly carnival releases all the wildness repressed through the rest of the year. Sex is freer, various laws are suspended, people go in disguises and the King of Fools is chosen to preside over the festival. Today, in Europe and North America, April the first remains ‘April Fool’s Day’, a time for tricks and practical jokes. The picture beside that of the Rider pack shows the Fool as conceived by Oswald Wirth. An older tradition than that of Waite, it pictures the archetype as a grotesque wanderer. This image has been interpreted variously as the soul before enlightenment, a newborn child entering the world of experience and the principle of anarchy. Elizabeth Haich has provided an interesting interpretation of Wirth’s grotesque image of the Fool. Placing him between SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM Judgement and the World, she describes the Fool as what the outside world sees when it looks upon someone who is truly enlightened. Because the Fool does not follow their rules or share their weaknesses, he appears to them in this ugly distorted way. Haich describes the Fool’s face as a mask, put there not by himself but by the outside world. The last card, the World, presents the same enlightened person, but viewed from inside, that is, by himself. In some early Tarot decks the Fool appeared as a giant court jester, towering over the people around him. His title was ‘the Fool of God’. The term has also been used for idiots, harmless madmen, and severe epileptics, all of whom were thought to be in touch with a greater wisdom precisely because they were out of touch with the rest of us. The archetype persists in modern popular mythology as well. By their fantastic primitive nature comic books often reflect mythological themes better than novels. In Batman the hero’s strongest enemy is called the Joker, a figure who has no past and is never seen without the wild make-up of a joker in a deck of cards. The joker, of course, descends directly from the Fool of tarochhi. The rivalry of Batman and the Joker sends a clear message to their readers: do not rebel against social values. Support law and order. In recent years the magazine has described the Joker as insane rather than criminal. To society the way of the Fool, instinct rather than rules, is a dangerous insanity. So far we have looked at the Fool as the ‘other’, prodding us from complacency with his jokes and disguises. As the ‘self’ he represents that long tradition of the foolish brother or sister, despised by the older brothers and sisters, yet finally able to win the princess or the prince through instinctive wit and kindness.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The Fool also helps us jump the gap from one line to the next, that is, from the Chariot to Strength, from Temperance to the Devil. To reach the Chariot or Temperance requires great effort and courage, and without the Fool’s readiness to leap into new territory we would likely stop with what we have already achieved. The Fool belongs as well with those cards of difficult passage, such as the Moon and Death (observe the winding road on each of these two), where he urges us on despite our fears. In the Minor Arcana the Fool relates first of all to Wands - action, eagerness, movement without thought. But it connects as well to Cups, with their emphasis on imagination and instinct. The Fool, in fact, combines these two suits. Later we will see that this combination, fire and water, represents the way of transformation.",
    "upright_meaning": "In readings the Fool speaks to us of courage and optimism, urging faith in ourselves and in life. At difficult times, when we come under pressure from people around us to be practical, the Fool reminds us that our own inner selves can best tell us what to do. The Fool can often symbolize beginnings, courageously leaping off into some new phase of life, particularly when that leap is taken from some deep feeling rather than careful planning.",
    "reversed_meaning": "For the Fool a reversal means first of all a failure to follow your instincts. It can mean not taking a chance at some crucial time, because of fear or depending too much on plans and the practical advice of others. Another reversed meaning of the Fool will appear at first to contradict the one just given. Recklessness, wildness, crazy schemes all seem the opposite of over-caution. And yet, they originate from the same weakness, a failure to act from inside. The reckless person superimposes a conscious or artificial foolishness on his life both because he does not trust the unconscious to act as a guide and because is also afraid of doing nothing. This second reversed meaning suggests another dimension to the Fool - the awareness that great chances must be taken only at the proper time. There are, after all, many times when caution is needed, and times when it is better to do nothing at all.",

    "description": "The Magician emerges very directly from the Fool in the image of the trickster-wizard. As mentioned above, Merlin fulfils both these roles (as well as that of teacher and wise man), and many other myths make the same connection. Earlier Tarot decks pictured trump number one as a conjurer rather than a magus, or even a juggler tossing coloured balls in the air. Charles Williams described him as a juggler tossing the stars and planets. Most modern images of the trump follow Waite’s wizard, raising a magic wand to bring into reality the spirit force - the energy of life in its most creative form. He holds the wand carefully, aware of that psychic power the Fool carried so lightly on his shoulder. Thus, the Magician, as the beginning of the Major Arcana proper, represents consciousness, action and creation. He symbolizes the idea of manifestation, that is, making something real out of the possibilities in life. Therefore, we see the four emblems of the Minor Arcana - lying on a table in front of him. He not only uses the physical world for his magical operations (the four emblems are all objects used by SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM wizards in their rituals), but he also creates the world, in the sense of giving life a meaning and direction. The Magician stands surrounded by flowers to remind us that the emotional and creative power we feel in our lives needs to be grounded in physical reality for us to get any value from it. Unless we make something of our potentials they do not really exist. ‘In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.’ The Bible begins at the moment the spirit descends into physical reality. For us, in the physical world, we can talk of nothing before this moment. In the linking of the Tarot with the Hebrew alphabet the Fool often receives the first letter Aleph. (Aleph bears no sound; it is a silent carrier of vowels, and therefore symbolizes nothingness. It is the first letter of the Ten Commandments.) This would assign the second Hebrew letter, Beth, the first letter with an actual sound, to the Magician. Beth is the first letter of Genesis. Look at Waite’s picture of the Magician. He is not casting spells, or conjuring up demons. He simply stands with one hand raised to heaven and the other pointed to the green earth. He is a lightning rod. By opening himself up to the spirit he draws it down into himself, and then that downward hand, like a lightning rod buried in the ground, runs the energy into the earth. Into reality.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The Magician symbolizes the idea of manifestation, that is, making something real out of the possibilities in life.",
    "upright_meaning": "The card means first of all an awareness of power in your life, of spirit or simple excitement possessing you. It can also mean, depending on its position and your reaction to it, someone else’s power affecting you. Like the Fool, the card refers to beginnings, but here the first actual steps. It can mean both the inspiration to begin some new project or phase of life, and the excitement that sustains you through the hard work to reach your goal. For many people the Magician can become a strong personal symbol for the creative force throughout their lives. Secondly, the Magician means will-power; the will unified and directed towards goals. It means having great strength because all your energy is channelled in a specific direction. People who seem always to get what they want in life are often people who simply know what they want and can direct their energy. The Magician teaches us that both will-power and success derive from being conscious of the power available to everyone. Most people rarely act; instead they react, being knocked from one experience to the next. To act is to direct your strength, through the will, to the places where you want it to go.",
    "reversed_meaning": "The Magician reversed signifies that in some way the proper flow of energy has become disrupted or blocked. It can mean a weakness, a lack of will or a confusion of purpose that leads to doing nothing. The power is there, but we cannot touch it. The card reversed can mean the lethargic apathy that characterizes depression. The reversed trump can also mean power abused, a person who uses his or her very strong character to exert a destructive influence on others. The most direct example of this would of course be the psychic aggression of‘black magic’. Finally, the Magician reversed indicates mental disquiet, hallucinations, fear and particularly fear of madness. This problem arises when the energy or spirit fire enters a person who does not know how to direct it into an outer reality. If we do not ground the lightning it can become trapped in the body and force itself on our awareness as anxiety or hallucinations. Anyone who has ever gone through a moment of total panic will know that acute mental anxiety is a very physical experience, a feeling of the body running wild, like a fire out of control.",

    "arcana": "major",
    "description": "The High Priestess Bill Butler, in The Definitive Tarot has commented on the historical¬ legendary sources for this female archetype. Throughout the Middle Ages the story persisted that a woman was once elected Pope. Disguised for years as a man, this supposed ‘Pope Joan 1 made her way through the Church hierarchy to the top position, only to die in childbirth during an Easter celebration. Pope Joan was most likely a legend; the Visconti Papess was real. In the late thirteenth century an Italian group called the Guglielmites believed that their founder, Guglielma of Bohemia, who died in 1281, would rise again in 1300 and begin a new age in which women would be popes. Jumping ahead they elected a woman named Manfreda Visconti as the first papess. The Church graphically ended this heresy by burning Sister Manfreda in 1300, the year of the expected new age. Some hundred years later the same Visconti family commissioned the first set of Tarot cards as we know them. Among these unnumbered and unnamed trumps appeared a picture of a woman later decks titled ‘The Papess'. The name persisted until the* eighteenth century when Court de Gebelin, believing the Tarot to originate in the Isis religion of ancient Egypt, changed the name to the High Priestess. Today both names exist (as well as ‘Veiled Isis’), and the Waite image of the THE OPENING TRUMPS 35 card derives directly from the Isis priestess’s symbolic clothing, particularly the crown representing the three phases of the moon. The Pope Joan legend and Manfreda Visconti are not simply historical curiosities. They illustrate a major social development in the Middle Ages, the reintroduction of the female and feminine principles into religion and cosmology. The images and the concepts 6 ' associated with the masculine role had dominated both the Church and Jewish religion for centuries. As a result ordinary people experienced the religions of the priests and rabbis as remote, harsh, and unapproachable, with their emphasis on sin, judgement, and punishment. They wanted qualities of mercy and love. And they identified these with women. Like a mother shelters her child from the somewhat distant strictness of the father, a female diety supposedly would intrude for the pathetic sinners against the unremitting judgement of the Father. It is interesting to realize that in many ways the Church saw Christ, as the Son, in exactly that role of introducing love and compassion. Yet, the people demanded a female. Even the idea of the Church as ‘Mother Church’ did not go far enough. Finally, the Church capitulated by raising the Virgin Mary almost to the level of Christ himself. Many writers and scholars believe that the elevation of Mary - as well as the priests’ costume of long skirts - originated in the Church’s desire to assimilate a persistent goddess religion from the days before Christianity. If this is true it would indicate not so much a cultural conservatism as the power of the female archetype to maintain a hold and partially triumph against suppression. In Judaism the official religion of the rabbis managed to resist any insurgent feminism. The people’s need, however, took hold in another area: the long tradition of the Qabalah. The Qabalists took a term from the Talmud, ‘Shekinah’, which meant God’s glory manifest in the physical world, and revised it to make it God’s anima, or female side. The Qabalists also revised the idea of Adam, making him originally hermaphroditic. The separation of Eve from Adam, even the separation of the Shekinah from God, became results of the Fall; the absence of the female from the official religion became almost a matter of sin rather than purity. So far we have looked at the benign motherly qualities of female mythological figures. Historically, however, female deities have always shown a dark, hidden side as well. To introduce the female at all is to introduce the whole archetype. The Tarot splits up the feminine archetype into two trumps and actually assigns the benign qualities to the second one (trump 3), the Empress. The High Priestess herself represents a deeper, more subtle aspect of the SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM female; that of the dark, the mysterious and the hidden. As such, she connects to the virgin side of the Virgin Mary, the pure daughter side of the Shekinah (who was pictured simultaneously as mother, wife, and daughter). We should realize that this assigning of qualities to women comes mostly from men and male ideas. The Qabalists, the occultists, and the Tarot designers, all deplored the separation of men and women into categories and taught unification as a final goal. This is shown by the World dancer of the Tarot. They were ahead of the established religion which even debated whether women had souls at all. Nevertheless, men still made the categories. To men, women have always appeared mysterious, strange, and, when safely in their mother role, loving and merciful. Women seem alien to men, more subtle in their sense, passivity allows the subconscious to emerge. Only through withdrawal from outer involvement can we allow the inner voice of vision and psychic forces to speak to us. It is precisely to avoid this inner voice that many people never rest from action and movement. Our society, based completely on outer achievement, fosters a terror of the subconscious; yet without its wisdom we can never fully know ourselves or the world. The High Priestess represents all these qualities: darkness, mystery, psychic forces, the power of the moon tr stir the subconscious, passivity, and the wisdom gained from it. This wisdom cannot be expressed in rational terms; to try to do so would THE OPENING TRUMPS be to immediately limit, narrow, and falsify it. Most people at some time have felt they understood something in such a deep way that they could never manage to explain it. Myths serve as metaphors for deep psychic feelings; yet the myths themselves, like the explanations given by theologians and anthropologists, are only symbols. The High Priestess signifies inner wisdom at its deepest level. She sits before two pillars, representing both the temple of Isis and the ancient Hebrew temple in Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God on earth, in other words, the home of the Shekinah. A veil hangs between the two pillars, indicating that we are barred from entering the place of wisdom. The image of the veiled temple or sanctuary appears in many religions. The Shekinah was indeed said to dwell within the veiled ark of the temple. Now, most people assume we are somehow forbidden to pass the pillars of the High Priestess. In reality, we simply do not know how to. To enter behind the veil would be to know consciously the irrational wisdom of the unconscious. That is the goal of the entire Major Arcana. Look carefully at Smith’s picture. You can see what lies behind the veil by looking between the veil and the pillars. And what lies behind is water. No great temple or complex symbols, simply a pool of water, a line of hills, and the sky. The pool signifies the unconscious and the truth hidden there. The water is motionless, the secrets in its darkest depths, hidden under a smooth surface. For most of us, at most times, the turbulent subconscious remains hidden under a placid layer of consciousness. We cannot enter the temple because we do not know how to go into ourselves; therefore we must travel through the trumps until we reach the Star and the Moon, where we can finally stir up the waters and return with the wisdom to the conscious light of the Sun. The temple introduces the image of the two pillars, and the theme of duality and opposites. The image occurs again and again through the trumps, in such obvious places as the Hierophant’s church pillars or the two towers of the Moon (the pillars of the High Priestess seen from the other side), but also in more subtle ways, such as the two sphinxes of the Chariot, or the man and woman of the Lovers. Finally, Judgement, with the child rising between a man and a woman, and the World, holding two wands, resolves the duality by uniting the inner mysteries with the outer awareness. The letters ‘B’ and ‘J’ stand for Boaz and Jakin, the names given to the two main pillars of the temple in Jerusalem. Obviously, the dark Boaz stands for passivity and mystery while Jakin symbolizes action and consciousness. Notice, though, that the letters carry the reverse indications, a white B and a black J. Like the dots in the Tao SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM symbol the letters signify that duality is an illusion, and each extreme carries the other imbedded inside it. In her lap she holds a scroll marked ‘Tora’. This name refers to the Jewish law, the Five Books of Moses which is usually spelled ‘Torah’ in English. This particular spelling allows the word to serve as an anagram for ‘Taro’. As the ultimate subject of all Qabalistic meditations (like Christ’s crucifixion for Christian mystics) the Torah carries a great deal of esoteric significance. The Qabalists believed that the Torah read on Saturday mornings in the synagogues was only a representation, a kind of shadow of the true Torah, the living word of God that existed before the universe and contains within it all true existence. The Tora held by the High Priestess, rolled up and partly concealed in her cloak, therefore signifies a higher knowledge closed to us with our lower understanding. We can describe it also as the psychic truths available to us only in the distorted form of myths and dreams. Earlier we spoke of the Fool coming in at crucial moments of change to push us along. The gap between the High Priestess and the Empress is one such moment. We can too easily be seduced by the dark coolness of the second trump, even if we never really penetrate its secrets. The person beginning in spiritual discipline often prefers to stay at the visionary level rather than go through the slow hard work needed to advance. Many people in more ordinary",

    "description": "The Empress represents the more accessible, more benign aspects of the female archetype. She is motherhood, love, gentleness. At the same time she signifies sexuality, emotion and the female as mistress. Both motherhood and sex derive from feelings that are non-intellectual and basic to life. Passions rather than ideas. The High Priestess represented the mental side of the female archetype; her deep intuitive understanding. The Empress is pure emotion. Like the Cunning Woman, we see her reflected in our movies and novels as the exasperating female, who both frustrates and delights, because her thought processes follow no rational development. Many women find this image insulting, partly because it represents values and approaches judged as negative by our patriarchal society, and partly because people make the error of assuming that women and men should personally express these archetypal ideas. But the social images are crippling in another way as well. They are trivial. The Empress, along with such mythological counterparts as Aphrodite or Ishtar or Erzulie, represent something very grand. They signify the passionate approach to life. They give and take experience with uncontrolled feeling. Until we learn to experience the outer world completely we cannot hope to transcend it. Therefore the first step to enlightenment is sensuality. Only through passion, can we sense, from deep inside rather than through intellectual argument, the spirit that fills all existence. Many people see religion as an alternative to the natural world, which they view as somehow impure or dirty. Though our cultural tradition fosters this duality it is really an illusion, and the person who approaches spirituality with this motivation to escape will likely never achieve a very developed understanding. The body, and the natural world, are realities that must be integrated rather than denied. In the mythology of Buddhism we find that the gods manipulated Prince Siddhartha’s father into providing his son, Gantama, with every sensual satisfaction. The father believed that pleasure would prevent his son from renouncing the world and becoming a Buddha. The scheme backfired, because only after he had completely experienced sensuality could the prince leave it behind. After renouncing the world Gautama joined the ascetics, the other pole. But he reached enlightenment only when he had rejected both extremes for the Middle Way. Thus, we can see the Buddha in the World dancer who holds both the Magician and the High Priestess lightly in her hands. As a combination of 1 and 2 the number 3 signifies synthesis and harmony. The natural world combines the Magician and the High Priestess in an indivisible unity of life and death, darkness and light. The idea of emotion also brings together the Magician archetype of activeness with the High Priestess archetype of instinct. Consider as well the process of creation. The Magician symbolizes the energy of life, the High Priestess the possibilities of future development. The reality of the Empress results from their combination. Recently Carl Sagan demonstrated that life on earth might have begun when a lightning bolt struck the primordial sea. Thus again, from the lightning of the Magician striking the waters of the High Priestess, comes the natural world. The symbolism of the Waite-Smith Empress reflects the idea of nature, with all its force and glory. The Empress herself, voluptuous and sensual, suggests passion. Her shield is a heart with the sign of Y r enus, the Roman version of the Great Goddess. Throughout the ancient world the goddess ruled, as Demeter, Astarte, Nut, until the patriarchal invaders demoted her to wife (and finally banished her altogether with an all-male godhead). At the Empress’s feet grows a field of grain; the goddess ruled agriculture, and in North-Western Europe was called the ‘Corn Goddess’. She wears a necklace of nine pearls, for the nine planets, while her crown contains twelve stars for the signs of the zodiac. In short, she wears the universe as her jewellery. The Great Mother is not the forms of nature, but the underlying principle of life. The stars are six-pointed, a symbol much older than its current use as a social emblem for Judaism. The six-pointed star combines two triangles; the upwards one symbolizes fire, the downwards one water. Again, the Empress combines trumps 1 and 2 in a new reality. A river flows from the trees behind her to disappear beneath her seat. This river is the force of life, running like a great current beneath all the separate forms of reality, and experienced most fully when we give ourselves to unrestrained passion. Deep in our selves we can sense the rhythm of a river, carrying us forward through experience until, with death, our individual lives return to the sea of existence. The river symbolizes also the unity of change and stability. The water in it is never the same, yet it always remains a particular river, with its own special qualities. Human beings change from day to day, the cells of our bodies die and new ones take their place, yet we always remain ourselves. The number 3 produced by the combination of 1 and 2 brings out yet another idea. Just as the numbers 1 and 2 stood specifically for male and female, so the number 3 signifies the child produced by their joining together. The child is born as a creature of nature, unburdened with ego and personality, experiencing the universe directly, without controls or labels. It is only as we grow older that we learn to put barriers between ourselves and life. It is one of the goals of the Tarot to return us to that natural state of directly experiencing the world around us. But if the Empress signifies the child she also stands for the mother. Motherhood is the basic means by which life continues throughout nature. And because the physical bond of the mother and child is so direct, mother love, in its strongest form, is pure feeling, given without intellectual or moral considerations. (This is, of course, an ideal, and in reality such love may come more from the male parent than the female, or sadly, not at all.) Throughout history people have identified motherhood with nature, so that the term ‘Great Mother’ for the earth itself appears all over the world, and even today we speak vaguely of Mother Nature.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The Great Mother is not the forms of nature, but the underlying principle of life.",
    "upright_meaning": "In readings the Empress represents a time of passion, a period when we approach life through feelings and pleasure rather than thought. The passion is sexual or motherly; either way it is deeply experienced, and in the right context can give great satisfaction. In the wrong context, when analysis is needed, the Empress can mean a stubborn emotional approach, a refusal to consider the facts. She can indicate another problem as well: self-indulgent pleasure when restraint is needed. Usually, however, she indicates satisfaction and even understanding gained through the emotions.",
    "reversed_meaning": "On the one hand it can signify a retreat from feeling, either rejecting your emotions or attempting to suppress your desires, particularly sexual. However, just as the High Priestess, upside down, added the missing element of involvement, so the Empress reversed can mean a new intellectual awareness, especially the solving of some complicated emotional problem by calmly thinking it through. In their right side up and reversed meanings trumps 2 and 3 are mirrors of each other. It sometimes happens that in a reading both will appear, upside down. This means that the person expresses both emotional and intuitive mental aspects, but in a negative way. Rationality comes as a reaction to excessive emotional involvement, while a feeling of isolation or coldness leads to passion. If the two aspects of the goddess can be experienced right side up the person will achieve a more stable and rewarding balance.",

    "description": "The Emperor For each child its parents are archetypes. Not just mother and father, but Mother and Father. Because our mothers give us life and feed us and shelter us we tend to see them as figures of love and mercy (and get very upset when they act harshly or coldly). But the Father, especially in traditional times when the sex roles were stricter, remained more remote, and therefore a figure of severity. It was the father who bore the authority and thus became the judge, the father who punished (and the mother who intervened) and the father who taught us the rules of society and then demanded obedience. To the child the father is in many ways indistinguishable from society as a whole, just as the mother is nature itself. One of the painful moments of maturity for many people comes when they discover the limited humanity of their parents. In Freud’s scheme of the mental development of the mate the father and the rules of society become directly linked. The infant psyche demands constant satisfaction, particularly in its desires for food and physical pleasure from the mother. (Freudians may claim the child desires actual intercourse with its mother, but the situation holds even if the child seeks only the pleasure of being held against the mother’s body.) By interfering in the child’s relationship to its mother the father arouses the child's hostility, and for the still unrepressed infant, this means a desire to do away with the interference altogether. The urge to destroy the father, however, cannot be consummated or even recognized, and so the psyche, to relieve the terrible dilemma, identifies itself with the Father image, creating a ‘super-ego’ as a new guide for the self (replacing the ‘id’ - the urges and desires which led to such a crisis). But what form does this super-ego take? Precisely that of the rules of society, traditionally learned under the father’s guidance. Trumps 3 and 4 of the Tarot represent the parents in their archetypal roles. But just as the Empress signified the natural world, so the Emperor carries the wider significance of the social world ‘married’ to nature. He symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them. In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddess’s representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. We see this drama (much like Freud’s substitution of super-ego for id) in many myths; such as Marduk, national hero of Babylon, killing Tiamat, the original mother of creation, because she is giving birth to monsters. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature. In Rome, the concept of law versus chaos was carried to the point where stability, or ‘law and order’ to use the modern term, became virtues in themselves, apart from the inherent morality of those laws. No progress can be made in conditions of anarchy (runs the argument); bad laws need to be changed, but first the law must be obeyed at all costs. Any other approach can only destroy society. Today, we see this viewpoint embodied in an abstraction we call the ‘system’. The Romans saw it more concretely in the personal figure of the Emperor, whom they described as the father of all his people. In the Emperor’s best aspect he indicates the stability of a just society that allows its members to pursue their personal needs and development. The natural world is chaotic; without some kind of social structure we could each spend all our lives fighting to survive. Society allows us both to work together and to benefit from the experience of those who lived before us. Stability allows spiritual development as well. In many countries society supports the churches (though whether this arrangement furthers spirituality is arguable); in some Eastern countries monks are free to pursue their studies because laymen fill their beggar bowls. Without this social custom they would have to spend their time working to get bread. In its more negative aspects the Emperor represents the power of unjust laws in a society where stability takes precedence over morality. Once we establish law and order as supreme then a corrupt ruler becomes a disaster. But if the entire system is corrupt, producing only bad rulers, then stability becomes the enemy of morality. The value of the symbol of the Emperor depends a very great deal on time and place. In an unjust society the Emperor’s power hinders, rather than helps, personal development. A great many people have gone to gaol for attacking unjust laws. Even at its best, however, the Emperor remains limited. Over the spontaneity of the Empress he has laid a network of repression. If we lose touch with our passions then life becomes cold and barren. The Rider pack Emperor (see fig. 5a) is drawn as old and stiff, dressed in iron, representing the sterility of a life rigidly governed by rules. The river which flowed so powerfully through the Empress’s garden has here become a thin stream, barely able to penetrate a lifeless desert. The card’s other symbolism reflects its dual aspects. He holds an ankh, Egyptian symbol of life, to indicate that under the law he bears the power of life and death, and will hopefully use it well. Four rams, symbols of Aries, adorn his throne while at the crown’s peak he bears the sign of Aries (unfortunately resembling a propellor). Now, Aries symbolizes force, aggression and war, but as the first sign of the zodiac it also signifies the new life of spring, which can emerge from the stability of a just society. As the middle card of the first line of the Major Arcana the Emperor represents a crucial test. In the process of growing up it is indeed the rules of society that many people find most difficult to surmount. We must absorb these rules, as well as our society’s traditions and beliefs, then go beyond them to find a personal code of conduct. This does not mean the attitude ‘rules are made to be broken’. People who feel compelled to flaunt all laws remain as bound to those laws as the person who follows them blindly. Because of the father’s role in teaching us acceptably social behaviour, people who are trapped at the level of the Emperor are often people who have never really accepted the ordinary humanity of their father. They may recognize it rationally but it disturbs and haunts them. Similar problems plague those people for whom the Empress remains their mother’s, rather than their own, passions and sensuality. The idea of the Emperor as that of the limited values of social structure arises mainly from Waite and his followers. The picture on the right at the start of this section, from Paul Foster Case’s Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) deck drawn by Jessie Burns Parke, illustrates another tradition. Here the Emperor symbolizes the sum total of spiritual knowledge. He is drawn in profile (this is much more common than the Rider pack full face image), linking them to the Qabalist image for God as the ‘Ancient of Days’, a seated king in profile. (The Ancient’s face was never visible, only his crown with a radiance beneath.) The Emperor’s arms and legs form an equilateral triangle over a cross, the alchemical sign for fire. This figure is later reversed (in Waite as well as Case) in the Hanged Man. As mentioned above, the crossed legs are an esoteric sign, found also on the card of the World. The BOTA Emperor sits on a cube rather than a throne. Also an esoteric symbol, the cube symbolizes both the world and the Tarot itself, as well as the Hebrew alphabet and the paths of the Tree of Life. The symbolism arises from the fact that a cube contains twelve edges, six faces, three axes, and of course a centre, adding up to twenty-two, the number of trumps, Hebrew letters, and paths. And because the Tree of Life is held to represent all creation the cube symbolizes the universe.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The Emperor symbolizes the laws of society, both good and bad, and the power that enforces them. In ancient times, where the Goddess reigned, the king performed a special function. New life can only come from death; therefore, each winter, the Goddess’s representatives sacrificed the old king, very often dismembering him and planting the pieces in the ground, thereby mystically fertilizing the earth. Later, when the male dominated religions took over, the king came to symbolize the rule of law which had clamped a lid of repression on what seemed to the patriarchs as the monstrous and chaotic darkness of the old order. Whether or not we see the old ways as monstrous or the new as civilized, the Emperor symbolizes the abstraction of society replacing the direct experience of nature.",
    "upright_meaning": "In readings the Emperor indicates (following the Rider pack image) the power of society, its laws and especially its authority to enforce those laws. The appearance of the trump indicates an encounter with the law. Again, the good or bad qualities depend on the context. More personally the Emperor can signify a time of stability and order in a person’s life, hopefully opening up creative energy. He also can indicate a specific person who holds great power, either objective or emotional, over the subject. This is very often the father, but it can also be a husband or lover, especially for those people who treat their lovers as substitute fathers to whom they surrender control of their lives.",
    "reversed_meaning": "Like the Empress reversed, the Emperor, when upside down, receives those elements complementary to his qualities when he is the right way up. He is, in Waite’s terms, ‘benevolence and compassion’; new life in a stony desert. But the pendulum can swing too far. The reversed Emperor can signify immaturity, and the inability to make harsh decisions and carry them through.",

    "description": "The Hierophant In most Tarot decks trump 5 is called either the Pope or the High Priest, terms which connect it by name as well as picture to trump 2, the archetype of inner truth. Waite wrote that he rejected ‘Pope’ because the title suggested a very specific example of the trump’s general idea. The name ‘Hierophant’ belonged to the high priest of the Greek Eleusinian mysteries. Now, Waite describes his card as symbolizing the ‘outer way’ of churches and dogma. But his use of the mystery term suggests another interpretation, one more favoured by those who see the Tarot as a secret doctrine of occult practices rather than a more general embodiment of human patterns. This interpretation is dramatically portrayed in the picture of the Hierophant from Aleister Crowley’s Book of Thoth, drawn by Frieda Harris. Here the trump signifies initiation into a secret doctrine, such as the various orders and lodges which flourished around the turn of the century and which have under¬ gone a revival in England and America. The Order of the Golden Dawn, to which Waite and Crowley at one time both belonged, possibly originated the term ‘Hierophant’ for trump 5. These two meanings, ‘outer way’ and ‘secret doctrine’, appear contradictory on the most elementary level. In reality they are very similar. Whether the two acolytes are being admitted to the Church or to an occult society, they are still entering a doctrine, with a set of beliefs which they must learn and accept before they can gain entrance. There is of course a fundamental difference between say, the catechism and the rituals of the Golden Dawn. For both, however, the trump indicates an education and a tradition. Therefore, if we see the first line as describing the development of the personality then the Hierophant, coming after the natural world and society, indicates the intellectual tradition of the person’s particular society, and his or her education in that tradition. Following Waite’s interpretation (and thinking specifically of the Western pope) we can see the Hierophant as a companion to the Emperor. The word ‘pope means ‘father’, and like the Roman Emperor the Pope is seen as a wise father guiding his children. Together, they share responsibility for humanity, the one providing physical needs, the other guiding spiritual growth. In one of the earliest treatises urging separation of Church and State, Dant? argued that the two functions must not be combined for fear of corruption. However, he never questioned the idea that the Church is responsible for our souls. Today, many people do not understand the basic idea of a priesthood. Our democratic age rejects the notions of an intermediary between an individual and God. Note, however, that the Hierophant can also symbolize the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ or any other elite leading the masses where they cannot go themselves. Originally the special function of the priests was evident; they spoke to the gods through the oracles, an often terrifying practice, and most people quite happily let someone else do it for them. When Christianity rejected such graphic and immediate connection to God, the idea of the priest became, like the Emperor, more abstract. Basically it depends on the notion that most people do not really care much about God. The average person is happiest following worldly pursuits, money, family and politics. There are, however, certain people who, by temperament, feel very directly the spirit that runs through all our lives. Called to the priesthood by their own inner awareness, these people can speak to God for us. More important, they can speak to us, interpreting God’s law so we may live proper lives, and eventually, after death, receive our reward of returning to God. After the resurrection we ourselves will dwell in sight of God. In life, however, we need the priests to guide us. So runs the argument. Even if we agree with the principle, in practice it tends to break down. People become priests for all sorts of reasons - ambition, family pressure, etc. - while those who do feel a genuine calling to communicate with God may show very little talent for communicating with people. Moreover, like the social institutions of the Emperor, the religious institutions of the Hierophant can easily become corrupted by the authority given them, so that the priests see their power as an end in itself, prizing obedience above enlightenment. Obviously, the position of defending a doctrine will attract doctrinaire people. Perhaps, however, we reject the idea of a guiding priesthood for a more subtle reason. Ever since the Reformation a notion that has gained greater and greater force in the West is that of the individual’s ultimate responsibility for him or herself. The whole idea of an outer doctrine, a code of rules and beliefs accepted on faith, depends on the assumption that most people prefer to have someone else tell them what to do.",

There are many people who, having given up the dogma forced on them as children, fall into some new dogma, a cult or some extremist political group, just as rigid and perhaps more shallow. Having rejected tradition they have not really rejected the Hierophant. They have not accepted the responsibility of truly finding their own way.",

    "description": "The Lovers Of the various changes Arthur Waite and Pamela Smith made in traditional Tarot designs the card of the Lovers remains the most dramatic. Where the Tarot de Marseilles (on the right, above) shows a young man struck by Cupid’s arrow and forced to choose between two women, the Rider pack shows a mature man and a single woman presided over by an angel. Further, while most decks indicate only a social situation; the Rider pack image clearly suggests the Garden of Eden, or rather, a new Garden of Eden, with the trees bringing enlightenment rather than the Fall. The earlier version of trump 6 sometimes bears the title 'The Choice’, and in divinatory readings means an important choice between two desires. Because one woman is fair and the other dark, a symbolism traditional in Europe where darkness always indicates evil and women in general indicate temptation, the choice was seen as between something respectable but perhaps dull, and something greatly desired but morally improper. The card can refer to a minor choice or even to a major crisis in a person’s life. We see this ancient symbolism today in the various novels and films of middle-aged, middle class men tempted to give up their loved but rather boring wives for a younger ‘wilder’ woman. The choice can, in fact, extend to a person’s whole life. Even those people who never question the boundaries of their middle class respectability have made a choice as much as the life-long criminal. And there are many people who outwardly live socially acceptable lives yet inwardly fight constant torments of desire, fighting urges to adultery, or violence, or simply a desire to leave home and become a wandering tramp. On the esoteric level the choice between the light and dark woman indicates the choice between the outer path (symbolized in the Rider pack by the Hierophant), where your life is laid out for you, and the inner path of the occultist, which can lead to a confrontation with your hidden desires. The Church labelled magicians as devil worshippers, and in Christian allegories the dark woman usually stood for Satan. These meanings all see the choice between light and dark in the widest possible terms. In the context of the first line of trumps we can see it in a much more specific way, that of the first real choice a person makes independently of his or her parents. Until the sexual urge rouses itself most people are content to act out their parents’ expectations for them. The sexual urge, however, points us where it wants to go. As a result we begin to break away in other areas as well. It is very rare that the partners our parents would choose for us are the ones we would choose for ourselves. If the difference is too extreme, or the parents too controlling, then the person can face a painful choice. Paul Douglas has commented that the darkhaired woman, who appears much older, is the boy’s mother, and the choice is whether to stay under her protection or strike out on his own. Those who believe, with Freud, that a boy’s first desire is directed towards his mother will see here a classic Oedipal dilemma. One part of the personality wishes to maintain the hidden fantasy life of a union with the mother, while another wishes to find a true love in the reality of the boy’s own generation. But we do not have to accept the Freudian doctrine to see the wider implications of this choice. Whether or not the boy secretly desires his mother the life lived under the parents’ protection is safe and comfortable. But he (or she, for girls basically face the same questions, though sometimes in different forms) can never become a true individual without making a break. And nothing indicates this more strongly than sexuality. Therefore, the traditional version of trump 6 represents adolescence. Not only does sexuality emerge at this time but also intellectual and moral independence. Cards 3, 4, and 5 represented us as shaped by the great forces of nature, society, and parents. In card 6 the individual emerges, a true personality with its own ideas and purposes, able to make important choices based, not on parental orders, but on its own assessment of desires and responsibilities. These meanings belong to the card’s traditional structure.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The sexual drive leads us away from isolation. It pushes us to form vital relationships with other people, and finally opens the way to love. Through love we not only achieve a unity with someone else, but we are given a glimpse of the greater meanings and deeper significance of life. In love we give up part of that ego control.",

    "card_number": 7,
    "suit": "major",
    "arcana": "major",
    "description": "The earlier versions of this card, which showed the Chariot pulled by two horses rather than two sphinxes, derives from a number of historical and mythological sources. Primarily it comes out of the processions given in Rome and other places for a conquering hero, when his chariot carried him through the streets that were filled with cheering citizens. The custom apparently answers some deep psychic need for group participation. We still practice it today, two thousand years later, in the parades given to presidents, generals, and astronauts, with open limousines replacing the chariot. The Chariot implies more than a greater victory. To drive a two horse vehicle at speed requires total control over the animals; the activity serves as a perfect vehicle for the powerful will. Plato, in the Phaedrus, refers to the mind as a chariot drawn by a black and white horse, the exact image of the Tarot. A certain Hindu myth tells of Shiva destroying a triple city of the demons. To do so he requires that all creation be subordinated to his will. The gods make a chariot for Shiva, using not only themselves but the heavens and the Earth as materials. The sun and moon become the wheels and the winds the horses. (The symbol on the front of the Tarot Chariot, like a nut and bolt, or a wheel and axle, is called the lingam and yoni, standing for Shiva, the masculine principle, and Parvati, the feminine principle, united in a single figure.) Through the myth’s images we learn that spiritual victory- over evil comes when we can focus all of nature, as well as the unconscious energy embodied in Shiva himself, through the conscious will. These two fables show two different aspects of the idea of will. The story of Shiva speaks of a true victory, in which the spirit has found a focus to release its total force. But the Phaedrus gives us an image of the triumphant ego, which controls rather than resolves the basic conflicts of life. Those Tarot commentators who see the cards as a group of separate images, each one contributing some vital lesson to our spiritual understanding, tend to give the Chariot its wider meaning. They point out that the Qabalistic title for the number 7, with all its mystic connotations, is ‘Victory’. In many places, particularly India, the horse became associated with death and funerals. When the rising patriarchy abolished the ritual sacrifice of the king, a horse was killed instead. The horse sacrifice became the most holy, associated with immortality. Even today, horses are used to pull the coffins of great leaders. (A bizarre junction of two aspects of the Chariot was seen in the death of John Kennedy. He was killed in his limousine during a parade, and then a horse - who rebelled against his trainer’s control - pulled his coffin in the state funeral.) These connections suggest the idea of the soul’s victory over mortality. When we look at the cards sequentially we see that 7 is only the victory of the first line of the Major Arcana. It crowns that line’s process of maturation, but by necessity it cannot address the great areas of the unconscious and super-conscious. Seen this way the Chariot shows us the developed ego; the lessons of the early cards have been absorbed, the adolescent period of searching and self- creation has been passed, and now we see the mature adult, successful in life, admired by others, confident and content with himself, able to control feelings, and above all, to direct the will. Like the Magician the Charioteer carries a magic wand. Unlike the Magician he does not raise it above his head to heaven. His power is subordinate to his will. His hands hold no reins. His strong character alone controls the opposing forces in life. The lingam and yoni indicate his mature sexuality which is under his control. Thus he is not the victim of his emotions and his sexuality contributes to a satisfying life. The glowing square on his chest, a symbol of vibrant nature, links him to the sensual world of the Empress, but the eight pointed star on his crown shows his mental energy directing his passions (symbolists consider the eight pointed star as halfway between the square of the material world and the circle of the spiritual). His chariot looms larger than the town behind indicating that his will is more powerful than the rules of society. However, the fact that his chariot is not in motion indicates that he is not a rebel. The wheels of the chariot rest on water, showing that he draws energy from the unconscious, though the chariot itself, resting on land, separates him from a direct contact with that great force. We have mentioned the sexual symbolism of the lingam and yoni. While Hindu myth connects horses to death, Freudian dream symbolism connects them to the sexual energy of the libido. By controlling the horses (or sphinxes) the Charioteer controls his instinctive desires. Various magic signs adorn his body.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The Chariot symbolizes maturity, accepting the limits of life, plus the faculty of speech, that is, rational understanding, which is used to define existence and therefore to control it.",
    "upright_meaning": "In a reading the card signifies that the person is successfully controlling some situation through the force of his or her personality. The card implies that a situation contains some contradictions and that these have not been brought together but simply held under control. This is not to stress too highly the negative undertones of the card. When it is the right way up the Chariot basically means success; the personality in charge of the world around it. If it appears as the outcome in a reading dealing with problems then it indicates victory-.",

    "description": "Strength Waite’s change of the Lovers was the most obvious of his Tarot alterations; his switch of Strength with Justice remains the most controversial. He himself gives no real reason for the change. ‘For reasons which satisfy myself, this card has been interchanged with that of Justice, which is usually numbered eight. As the variation carries nothing which will signify to the reader there is no cause for explanation.’ The reasons are certainly more than personal. Not only Waite but Paul Foster Case and Aleister Crowley placed Strength as 8 and Justice as 11. Probably they all followed the Order of the Golden Dawn, whose secret Tarot deck also switched the two cards. This connection to a secret order suggests the idea of initiation. Now, the Golden Dawn, of course, did not originate the practice of initiation, though it claimed to receive its specific rituals directly from spirit instructors. Initiation goes back thousands of years and is seen all over the world, from Egyptian temples to the Australian desert. It represents a special means of psychological transformation - the very subject of the Tarot’s middle line. By referring Justice and the cards around it to this ancient idea we gain a wider under¬ standing of the Tarot as an experience. TURNING INWARDS It is worth considering the implications of the old arrangement of trumps. The image of Justice suggests weighing your life in the balance. The second line takes us away from the outer achievements of the first and into the self. Thus Justice in the first position would mean an assessment of what your life has meant to you, followed by a decision to search inward for greater meaning. Obviously, this fits very nicely. But if Justice comes first then all these things occur rationally; the assessment arises as a conscious reaction to dissatisfaction. How much more powerful this assessment appears when it arises from within, forced on us by the powerful vision of the Wheel of Fortune. The double-edged sword of Justice implies action, a response to the knowledge gained in the assessment. The idea of response leads directly to the Hanged Man. If Justice came first then the Hermit would follow it. As a seeker of wisdom the Hermit would also represent a valid response to Justice. But again, if we allow that wisdom to come before Justice, then the Hanged Man shows a response from deep inside. Now consider Strength in both places. The picture shows a woman taming a lion. Briefly, the image suggests the energy of the unconscious released and calmed, ‘tamed’ by the direction of conscious understanding. Such an idea would easily belong in the middle position. We would then describe the card as the central test of the whole line. And certainly the peacefulness and great reversal of the Hanged Man would follow Strength perfectly. But we can also see Strength as the qualities vital for beginning the line. The search inward cannot be accomplished by the ego. We need to confront feelings and desires long hidden from our conscious thoughts. If we attempt to transform ourselves by a wholly rational process we create another kind of persona. Something very like this in fact happens quite often. Many people feel a lack of spontaneity in their lives. They look around them or read books on psychology, and observe, with a certain jealousy, or even shame at their own repressions, the characteristics of spontaneous people. And then, rather than follow the fearful process of releasing their hidden fears and desires, they carefully imitate spontaneity. They have extended the Chariot to a new domain. By making Strength number 8 we set it against the Chariot, as a different kind of power, not the ego’s will, but the inner Strength to confront yourself calmly and without fear. The mysteries can be brought out because we have found the Strength to face them. The lion signifies all the feelings, fears, desires, and confusions suppressed by the ego in its attempt to control life. The charioteer drew upon his inner feelings as a source of energy, but was always SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM careful to direct that energy where he consciously decided it should go. Strength allows the inner passions to emerge, as the first step in going beyond the ego. On a very simple level we can see this emergence of suppressed feelings in the person who allows him or herself to act ‘childishly’, to weep or scream; in short, to do all those things that previously seemed foolish or embarrassing. On a deeper level the lion symbolizes the whole force of personality, usually smoothed over by the demands of civilized life. Strength releases this energy in order to use it as a kind of fuel, propelling us along the inner path of the Hermit. This purpose can only be accomplished because the lion is ‘tamed’ at the same time that it is released. Strength opens up the personality like Pandora opening her box. It does so, however, with a sense of peace, a love of life itself, and a great confidence in the final",
    "symbolic_meaning": "Strength’s position, as first in the line, links the card to the Magician, as does the infinity sign, another reference to 8, above her head. The reversal of sex indicates a joining of aspects from both the male and female archetypes. The Magician’s active involvement with life has been modified by the inner peace implied in the High Priestess. The woman’s sensual figure, her blonde hair, and the flower belt linking her to the lion, connect the card to the Empress as well. The Empress represents natural instincts and passion; again we see the image of emotional energy, the ‘animal desires’ as some Tarot commentators call it, released and tamed. Waite describes the flower belt as a second infinity sign, with one loop around the woman’s waist, the other around the lion’s neck. We can describe Strength as the Magician united with the Empress; that is, the Magician’s power of consciousness and direction has mingled with the Empress’s sensuality, giving it a sense of purpose and leading to the Hermit.",
    "upright_meaning": "In readings the card of Strength indicates the ability to face life, and particularly some difficult problem or time of change, with hope and eagerness. It shows a person strong from within, experiencing life passionately yet peacefully, without being controlled or carried away by those passions. The card represents the finding of the strength to begin or continue some difficult project, despite fear and emotional strain. If Strength appears in connection with the Chariot it can signify an alternative to force and will-power, especially, of course, if the Chariot is reversed. The two cards can also symbolize complementary sides, the best configuration being Strength in the position of the inner self, and the Chariot in the position of the outer (the vertical and horizontal lines of a cross). Then we see a person who acts powerfully but with a sense of calm.",
    "reversed_meaning": "Strength reversed indicates first of all weakness. The courage to face life fails and the person feels overwhelmed and pessimistic. It signifies also a torment from within. The bestial side of the lion breaks away from the unity of spirit and sensuality. The passions become the enemy, threatening to destroy the conscious personality and the life it has built up for itself.",

    "description": "The Hermit Like the six-pointed star within the Hermit’s lantern, the idea of the Hermit goes in two directions; one inner, one outer. Primarily the card means a withdrawal from the outer world for the purpose of activating the unconscious mind. We see this process symbolized in the downward pointing ‘water’ triangle, as the alchemists called it. But the Hermit also signifies a teacher who will show us how to begin this process, and will help us find our way. The upward pointing ‘fire’ triangle symbolizes this special guide, who might be an occult teacher, a therapist, our own dreams, or even a spirit guide evoked from within the self. The image of the Hermit occupied a special place in the medieval imagination. Living in the woods or the desert, totally withdrawn from all the normal concerns of humanity, the hermit presented an alternative to the Church. The European version of a yogi ascetic, he demonstrated the possibility of approaching God through personal experience. People often looked upon the hermits as living saints, and attributed magic powers to them, in the way that yoga disciples will tell wonderful stories about their masters. Though the hermit withdrew from society he or she did not withdraw from humanity. Among other functions, they gave shelter and sometimes blessings to travellers. Countless stories, especially the Grail legends, depict the hermit who acts as a giver of wisdom to the knight on a spiritual quest. Again, we see the Hermit’s double image: example and guide. The Hermit image has persisted long after the special practice has died away. The transcendental philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson travelled days through remote Scotland to find the cabin of Thomas Carlyle. Emerson’s friend, Henry David Thoreau, himself lived in a cabin at Walden Pond to find a sense of himself and of nature. He then wrote about it as an example to others. Nietzsche’s Dus Sprach ^arathustra enshrined the Hermit’s image; the book begins with Zarathustra’s return after achieving personal transformation. And today, countless people have given themselves to Eastern gurus in the hope that these hermit-like teachers can transform their lives. For those who cannot find an actual guide the psyche will often provide one. Jung and his followers have described their patients’ many dreams of wise old men guiding them on mysterious journeys into the psyche. In many cases dream analysis discovered that the dream guide actually stood for the therapist. The unconscious can recognize a Hermit teacher before the conscious mind can. The great thirteenth century Qabalist, Abraham Abulafia, described three levels of Qabalah. The first was doctrine; that which can be learned from texts. The second came from the direct guidance given by a personal teacher, while the third, the most developed, was the direct experience of ecstatic union with God. These three levels connect very directly to the Tarot, not only in the three lines, but in three specific trumps which together form an isosceles triangle. The first level we see in the Hierophant; the third, directly below the Hierophant, one level removed, appears in the joyous child of card 19, the Sun. The second level, however, comes not in the card between them, the Hanged Man, but on the other end of the pattern, as the second card in the second line, the Hermit. Doctrine and mystery both come as the end of a process; doctrine because you first must arrange your life before you can approach the study of a special way (Qabalists often restricted certain important texts to people over thirty-five), and ecstasy because you first must pass the archetypal confrontation with darkness and mystery. A guide, however, appears at the very start of the journey, after the traveller has found the Strength to begin. As an emblem of personal development, rather than a guide, the Hermit signifies the idea that only by withdrawing from the outer world can we awaken the inner self. Those who see the Tarot in two halves, with the Wheel of Fortune as the mid-point, view the Hermit TURNING INWARDS as the period of contemplation before the Wheel of Life turns towards its second half. When we view the Tarot in lines of seven we see that this withdrawal, and the vision of the Wheel itself, are steps towards a greater goal. We see the Hermit on a cold lonely peak. He has left the world of the senses to enter the mind. This image of the mind as stark and chill conveys only a partial truth, or rather, an illusion. The mind is rich with symbols, with joy, with the light and love of the spirit. But before we can apprehend these things we must first experience the mind as a silent alternative to the noisy world of the senses. For shamans the barren peak is often a direct reality. In places as far apart as Siberia and ...",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The star both as a symbol of the Hermit as teacher, and also as a light of the unconscious, beckoning us to discover its secrets. It further signifies the goal of resolving the opposites of life. The water and fire triangles traditionally represent not only two elements usually opposed, but also male and female united in a single form. The Hermit’s staff suggests a wizard’s staff, and therefore the magic wand of the Magician. Whereas the Fool used the wand instinctively, the Hermit leans on it as a conscious support. It therefore symbolizes the teaching which helps open the inner awareness. Directly below the High Priestess the Hermit relates to her principle of withdrawal, indicating again that we must in some sense leave the outer world if we wish to work on ourselves.",
    "upright_meaning": "The divinatory meanings for the Hermit derive from both its aspects. On the one hand it symbolizes a withdrawal from outer concerns. The person may physically remove himself, but this is not really necessary. What matters is the inner transfer of attention from ‘getting and spending’ as Wordsworth called our worldly activities, to a person’s inner needs. It therefore requires an emotional withdrawal from other people and from activities once thought to be all-important. The card carries within it a sense of deliberate purpose, of withdrawing to work on self-development. In connection with this sense of purpose and with the picture of an old man the card symbolizes maturity, and a knowledge of what really matters in a person’s life. The card can also signify assistance from a definite guide, sometimes, as indicated above, a psychic guide from within, but more often a real person who will help you in your self-discoveries. Sometimes we do not ourselves recognize that such a guide exists for us. If the Hermit appears in a Tarot reading it may be wise to look carefully at the people around you. If you are involved in helping others find understanding then the Hermit can symbolize you in your role as guide and teacher.",
    "reversed_meaning": "When we reverse the card we corrupt the idea of withdrawal. In the same way that the High Priestess reversed can mean a fear of life, the Hermit reversed can indicate a fear of other people. If we withdraw from society as a retreat then the fact of withdrawal becomes more and more dominant, leading to phobias and paranoia. As with other trumps the negative and positive aspects of the Hermit depend on the context. The Hermit reversed can sometimes simply mean that at this moment the person needs to become involved with other people. Because the card, when the right way up, suggests maturity the Hermit reversed can sometimes indicate a Peter Pan attitude to life. The person hangs on to basically meaningless activities, or else imitates childlike enthusiasm (like the imitation of spontaneity) as a way of avoiding the responsibilities of doing something with his or her life.",

    "card_number": 10,
    "suit": "major",
    "arcana": "major",
    "description": "The Wheel of Fortune Like certain other trump cards (most notably Death) the Wheel of Fortune derives from a medieval homily. The Church considered pride the greatest of sins, for in pride you set yourself before Christ. TURNING INWARDS One lesson against pride was the idea of a great king falling from power. In many versions of the King Arthur legend, the king dreams or sees before him on the eve of his final battle, a vision of a rich and powerful king seated on top of a wheel. All of a sudden the goddess Fortuna turns the wheel and the king gets crushed at the bottom. Sobered, Arthur realises that no matter how much secular power we accrue, our fate rests always in God’s hands. The Visconti cards, on the right, above, enshrines this practical sermon. Now, we might consider this neat moral fable to be far removed from the powerful and mysterious symbols staring at us from the Waite-Smith card, on the top left, and the Oswald Wirth version on the bottom left. But Fortuna and her shining hoop have a curious history. First of all, the medieval image derives from a much earlier time, when Fortuna represented the Great Goddess, and the crushed king was a real event. Every year, at mid-winter, the priestesses sacrificed the king; by imitating the death of the year they humbled themselves to the Goddess’s power, and by choosing a new king they subtly suggested to her that she might once more create spring out of winter - an event by no means automatic to people who did not believe in ‘natural laws’ such as gravity. Thus, the Wheel originally symbolized both the mystery of nature and the human ability to take part in that mystery through a ritual sacrifice. Notice that the card comes directly below the Empress, the emblem of the Great Mother herself. By the Middle Ages the Wheel had lost its original meaning; this did not mean that it had lost its power to suggest the mystery of life. In Thomas Malory’s version of the King Arthur story we find the suggestion that the Wheel symbolizes the random turnings of‘luck’. Why do some people get rich and others poor? Why should a powerful king fall, and a formerly weak one rise to power? Who, or what, controls the turning wheel of life? Malory suggests that luck, seemingly meaningless ups and downs, is in reality fate; that is, the destiny God has chosen for each individual, based on reasons only God can understand. Because we cannot understand those reasons we say that the events of people’s lives arise out of luck, but it all belongs to God’s plan. With the Wheel, therefore, we come to the great question of how and why anything happens at all in the universe. What makes the sun shine? Burning elements, yes, but what makes them burn? How did atomatic energy come into existence? Why should spring follow winter, after all? Why, and how, does gravity work? Going further, we find that fate is also an illusion, a dodge to cover up the fact that we, with our limited vision, cannot see the inner connection between all things. ‘Oh well,’ we say, ‘it’s fate’, a meaningless statement SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM because we cannot understand the meaning. Things do not just happen, they are made to happen. The power to shape events, to give life and form and purpose to the universe, belongs, Malory tells us, to the Holy Ghost, dwelling in the physical world as a presence within the Holy Grail (the Ace of Cups) in the same way that the Shekinah physically dwelt within the veiled sanctuary of the temple at Jerusalem. We come then to the truth that both the random events of life and the so-called ‘laws’ of the physical universe are mysteries leading us to an awareness of the spirit force drawn down by the upraised arm of the Magician and manifested in the natural world of the Empress. A great many mystics and shamans have said that their visions showed them how all things connect, how everything fits together, because the spirit unites the entire universe. Possibly we would all see and understand this grand scheme of life, if it were not for the fact that we do not live long enough. Our short lives narrow our vision to such a miniscule portion of the world that life appears meaningless. Now, this idea of the Wheel as the mystery of fate, with its hidden meaning, fits very well the modern Waite-Smith version of the card, especially when we consider it as halfway to the final trump. If we place the Rider pack Wheel beside the World we see immediately the link between them. In one we have a wheel filled with symbols; in the other we find a wreath of victory, and inside it a dancer who embodies the truth behind the symbols. Even more striking, we find the same four animals on each card in the corners, except that the mythological beings of card 10 have been transformed into something real and alive in the World. Thus, at the halfway point, we receive a vision of the inner meaning of life; at the end that vision has become real, embodied in our own being.",

    "description": "Justice The image of this trump derives from the Greek Titaness Themis, who appears, with her blindfold and scales, on court house frescoes throughout the Western world. The legal Justitia, to give her her Latin name, was blindfolded to demonstrate that the law does not discriminate and applies to weak and powerful alike. The principle of social justice, however, properly belongs to the Emperor, directly above Justice. Card 11 indicates that the psychic laws of Justice, by which we advance according to our ability to understand the past, depends on seeing the truth about ourselves and about life. The Tarot Justitia, therefore, wears no blindfold. So far, we have spoken of the second line as a process of withdrawal from outer concerns to awaken the inner vision of ourselves and of life. But a vision of the underlying nature of things is meaningless if it does not produce an active response. We must always act (the Magician principle) on the wisdom received from the inner self (the High Priestess principle). Not just the perfectly balanced scales but all the images on the card point to an equilibrium between understanding and action. The figure, a woman, appears androgynous; though she sits firmly on her stone bench she looks poised to stand; one foot points outward from her robe, the other remains hidden. The sword, an emblem of action, points straight upward, indicating both resolve and the idea that wisdom is like a sword piercing through the illusion of events to find the inner meaning. Two-edged, the sword signifies choice. Life requires us to make decisions; at the same time each decision, once made, cannot be revoked. It becomes part of us. We are formed by the actions we have taken in the past; we form our future selves by the actions we take now. The scales also represent the perfect balance of past and future. Past and future balanced, not in time, but in the clear sight of Justice staring out at you from the exact centre of the Major Arcana.",

    "arcana": "major",
    "description": "The Hanged Man After the crisis of seeing what you have made of your life comes the peace of acceptance; after Justice, the Hanged Man. Artists, writers, and psychologists have all felt drawn to this card, with its hints of great truths in a simple design. We have already referred to the occult tradition behind the upside down posture and crossed legs. In discussing Strength we said that occultists seek to release the energy of the desires and transform it into spiritual energy. Many occultists particularly the alchemists, have believed that one very direct way to do this is literally to stand on your head, so that gravity will pull down the energy from the genitals to the brain. Of course, only the most naive and optimistic alchemist would have expected such a thing to literally happen. They may have believed that trace elements found in genital fluid will seep down and affect the brain; more to the point, the reversal of physical posture serves as a very direct symbol of the reversal of attitude and experience that comes through spiritual awakening. Where everyone else is frenzied, you will know peace. Where other people believe themselves to be free, but are actually pushed from one thing to another by forces they do not understand, you will achieve true freedom by understanding and embracing those forces. The Hanged Man hangs on a tree shaped like the letter T. Now, TURNING INWARDS this is the bottom half of an ankh, Egyptian symbol of life and is sometimes called a Tau cross. According to Case the ankh in Egypt stood for the Hebrew letter Tau, which is the letter belonging to the World. Thus, the Hanged Man lies halfway to the World. We see this as well in the fact that 12 is 21 backwards, and if you turn the Hanged Man upside down (making the man himself right side up) you will have almost the same figure as the World Dancer. When we ask. therefore, what card serves as the halfway point for the Major Arcana, the answer is not one but three - the Wheel, Justice, and the Hanged Man, symbolizing a process rather than a moment. Notice that while the Dancer extends her arms with their magic wands the Hanged Man keeps his arms crossed behind his back. Remember also that he is upside down. At this stage a deep spiritual awareness can only be maintained by withdrawing from society. In the World we see that same awareness maintained amidst all the outer activities of life. He hangs on an ankh, which makes his tree the Tree of Life. Recalling Odin sacrificing himself on Yggdrasil we can also call the gallows the World Tree. This tree begins in the underworld (the unconscious), and reaches up through the physical world (the conscious) to heaven (the super-conscious). The ideas first represented by the diagram of the Lovers have begun to actually happen. What we saw previously as concepts now becomes, after Justice, a genuine experience. The Hanged Man’s number, 12, is 2 times 6, that is, the High Priestess raising the Lovers to a higher level. Beyond all its symbolism the Hanged Man affects us because it shows a direct image of peace and understanding. The calm shows so strongly in the card because the Hanged Man has surrender involved joining the rituals instead of just watching them. For many modern people it involves releasing the emotions they have locked up for years. Notice that both these things are acts; surrender to the World Tree is an actual step we take, not a passive waiting. T.S. Eliot’s poem The Wasteland links the idea of an individual surrender to emotions with both the barrenness of European life after World War I and the ancient Grail mysteries. The wounded Fisher King can be healed by a ‘moment’s surrender which an age of prudence can never retract’. Earlier in the poem the hero is told ‘Fear death by drowning’. The ego sees surrender as death - dissolution in the sea of life. The person who gives this warning is a Tarot reader. Eliot’s poem helped to popularize Tarot cards in the 1920s. Specifically, it made famous the Hanged Man. Actually, the Hanged Man does not appear in the poem but is important because of his absence. SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM Eliot claimed to really know nothing of the Tarot, but only to use some images from it. Apparently, however, he knew at least one esoteric fact unknown to even many Tarot commentators - that, according to some esoteric writers the Hanged Man ‘originally’ bore the title, ‘The Drowned Phoenician Sailor’. Madame Sosostris applies this title to the hero. ‘This is your card.’ Surrender is his destiny, but he has denied it: ‘I do not find the Hanged Man.’ The crossed legs represent the number 4 upside down. 4 symbolizes the earth with its four directions. By reversing his own sense of values the Hanged Man has turned the world on its head. The arms and head together form a downward pointing water triangle. The way to the super-conscious is through the unconscious. The Golden Dawn card on the right of the Rider version shows the Hanged Man suspended over water. Most Tarot Qabalists assign the letter ‘Mem’ to this card. Mem stands for ‘seas’ or the element of water. We therefore see 4, the world, consciousness, and 3, here representing water, or the unconscious, in the Hanged Man’s body. These numbers multiplied form 12. In multiplication the original numbers become dissolved and form something greater than their sum. The number 12, like 21, suggests both 1 and 2. The card reflects the Magician in the sense that the power drawn down by the wand has now entered the Hanged Man; we see it as the circle of light about his head. The experience of really feeling the spirit force within life is one of great power and excitement in the midst of complete calm. The number 2 suggests the High Priestess; so does the image of water. Both cards indicate a withdrawal, but where trump 2 indicated the archetype of receptivity, trump 12 shows an experience of it. 1 plus 2 equals 3. The Empress directly felt life through emotional involvement, the Hanged Man feels it through inner awareness.",

Our awareness of life always remains second-hand, never a direct experience but only a series of stereotypes, like the person who models his or her behaviour on the orders of parents and the actions of movie stars. The card reversed also means fighting your inner self in some way. It can mean the person who tries to deny some basic part of himself or simply the person who cannot accept reality and who in some way or other is constantly battling life. By putting his or her ego against the world this person too never fully experiences life.",

    "description": "Death As much as the Lovers (directly above Death) Arthur Waite’s design for trump 13 departs from standard Tarot imagery. The picture on the right, above, comes from the esoteric Golden Dawn Tarot, but, even so, illustrates the older, essentially social message of Death. Death strikes everyone, kings and commoners alike. This basic democracy of death was a favourite theme of medieval sermons. As an idea it goes back at least as far as the Jewish practice of burying everyone in the same style, a white shroud and a plain pine box, so that in death rich become level with the poor. As we might guess, the great power of death leads us beyond democracy to both philosophical and psychological meanings. Death, like life, is eternal and always present. Individual forms are SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM always dying while others come into existence. Without death to clear away the old, nothing new could find a place in the world. Many science fiction novels have shown the tyrannical society that would result if the world’s leaders did not die. The liberation of Spain after the death of Franco aptly demonstrated death’s importance. When we die our flesh decays, leaving only the skeleton. That too will eventually pass but it lasts long enough to at least hint at eternity. Therefore, the skeleton in the Golden Dawn card implies that eternity triumphs over the transitory. Now, the skeleton has an occult meaning as well. All over the world the training for shamans includes methods of seeing one’s own skeleton, using drugs, meditation, even scraping the skin off the face. By freeing the bone from the flesh shamans connect themselves to eternity. Because people fear death they seek reason and value in it. The Christian religion teaches us that death liberates our souls from the sinful flesh so that we may join God in a greater life to come. Carl Jung has written of the value of believing in an afterlife. Without it, death may seem too monstrous to accept. Other people have pointed out that death joins us to nature. The consciousness that isolates us from the world will be obliterated; though the body will decay, that only means that it is feeding other creatures. Each death brings new life. Many people find the notion of themselves being eaten horrible to contemplate. The modern practice of embalming and painting corpses so that they look alive, and then of burying them in sealed metal caskets derives from the desire to maintain the body’s separateness from nature even in death. The fact is, since we will not know what happens to our bodies once the spirit has left them, what we really fear is the destruction of the personality. It is the ego that sees itself as separate from life; because it is only a mask the ego does not wish to die. It wishes to make itself superior to the universe. If we can accept death we will be able to live more fully. The ego never wants to release energy; it tries to hoard it against the fear of death. As a result new energy cannot get in. We see this very graphically in peoples breathing when they panic. They try to gulp air in without letting any out and as a result become short of breath. In sex too the ego hoards energy. It fights climax and surrender because at that moment the ego partly dissolves. In Elizabethan England sexual intercourse was often called ‘dying’. And Death in the Tarot comes below the Lovers. Because the ego resists the very idea of death and therefore keeps us from enjoying life we must sometimes take extreme steps to get TURNING INWARDS past it. The initiation rites always led up to a simulated death and rebirth. The initiate is led to believe that he or she is actually about to die. Everything is done to make this death as real as possible so that the ego will be tricked and in fact experience that dreaded dissolution. Then, when the initiate is ‘reborn’ he or she experiences a new maturity and a new freedom of energy. In recent years many people have experienced something very like these rites through using psychedelic drugs. They believe they are dying and they feel themselves reborn. However, without the preparation symbolized in the Hanged Man the experience can often be deeply disturbing. Contrary to what many people believe the card of Death does not actually refer to transformation. Rather, it shows us the precise moment at which we give up the old masks and allow the transformation to take place. Perhaps we can understand this better if we consider the Tarot’s parallel in psychotherapy. By force of will (Strength) the person, with the help of the therapist-guide (the Hermit), allows knowledge to emerge of who he or she really is, and what habits or fears he or she wishes to shed (Wheel and Justice). This knowledge brings calm and a desire to change (the Hanged Man). But then a fear sets in. ‘If I give up my behaviour’, the person thinks, ‘maybe there will be nothing left. I will die.’ We live under the ego’s control for so many years we come to believe that nothing else exists. The mask is all we know. Often people will stay stuck in therapy for years because they fear release. The nothingness of the Fool terrifies them. People who have been fat for years often experience a similar fear if they try to diet. ‘I have always been fat’, they think. ‘I am a fat person. If I get skinny I will not exist any more.’ The fact is, this is true. The ‘I* that was a fat person will no longer exist. But something else will emerge. The Waite image for trump 13 increases the psychological meaning of the card. The four people demonstrate different approaches to change. The king, struck down, shows the rigid ego. If life comes at us with enough power the ego may collapse; insanity can result from an inability to adjust to extreme change. The priest stands and faces Death directly; he can do so because his stiff robes and hat protect him and support him. We see here the value of a code of belief to help us past our fears of death. The Maiden symbolizes partial innocence. The ego is not rigid, yet still aware of itself, unwilling to surrender. Therefore she kneels but turns away. Only the child, representing complete innocence, faces Death with a simple offering of flowers. Death wears black armour. We have already seen how blackness and darkness symbolize the source of life as well as its end. Black SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM absorbs all colour; death absorbs all individual lives. The skeleton rides a white horse. White repels all colours and therefore symbolizes purity, but also nothingness. The white rose stands for the desires purified, for when the ego dies selfish and repressive needs die with it. At the back of the card we see a sun rising between two pillars. The ego belongs to the outer world of duality, separating and categorizing experience. Through Death we feel the radiant power of Life, which knows only itself. The landscape before the pillars reminds us of the ‘land of the Dead’ described in all mythologies. We fear the death of our old selves because we do not know what to expect afterwards. One main function of those shamans who see their skeletons is to go ahead through the Land of the Dead and thus be able to guide the souls of others. A river flows through the middle of the card. Rivers, as we saw with the Empress, indicate the unity of change and eternity. The fact that they lead to the sea reminds us of the formlessness and oneness of the universe. The boat, reminiscent of the Pharaohs’ burial boats, symbolizes the true self carried through Death to a new life. No matter the picture, all Tarot cards bear the number 13. Though most people consider 13 unlucky they do not know why. In our culture 13 refers to Judas, since he was the thirteenth man at the Last Supper, and therefore the number indicates Christ’s (and all people’s) death. Friday the thirteenth is especially unlucky because Christ died on a Friday. But we can also describe Christ as the thirteenth man. Death leads to resurrection. In a more symbolic sense 13 is unlucky because it takes us beyond 12. 12 is something of a‘perfect’number. It combines the archetypes of 1 and 2, it symbolizes the zodiac and therefore the universe, it can be divided by 1,2, 3, 4, and 6, more digits than any other number. 13 destroys this elegance. It can be divided by nothing but 1 and itself. Again, we can go beyond the negative aspects of the symbolism. Precisely because it ruins the perfection of 12, 13 signifies a new creation; death breaks up old forms and makes way for the new. The number 13 adds up to 4, the Emperor. Through Death we overcome our outer ‘social’ selves. Since 13 is a higher form of 3 the card also recalls the Empress, and reminds us again that in nature life and death are inseparable.",

    "description": "Temperance, appearing below the Chariot, shows a person whose behaviour is once again connected to the real world but in a way more meaningful than ever before. For if the child relates directly to life it does so without consciousness, and as consciousness grows so does the ego. Temperance indicates the ability to combine spontaneity with knowledge. The term ‘temperance’ means moderation. For most people this means self control. The Tarot Temperance, however, does not go to extremes simply because extremes are not necessary. Not an artificial inhibition according to a moral code, but exactly the opposite; a true and proper response to all situations as they arise. The word ‘temperance’ derives from the Latin ‘temperare’ which means ‘to mix’ or ‘to combine properly’. The person who has released his or her inner self is characterized not only by moderation but by an ability to combine the different sides of life. Many people can only deal with life by parcelling it off into sections. They create one personality for business and another for their private lives; both are false. They consider certain moments and situations to be ‘serious’ and others to be ‘fun’ and are careful never to smile at a serious subject. The people they love are often not the people whom they find sexually attractive. All these separations derive from the inability to take life as it comes, moment by moment. Temperance combines the elements of life. In reality it combines the elements of the personality, so that the person and the outer world will flow together naturally. The trump displays the signs of combination all through the picture. When we look at the Waite-Smith image on the left we see first of all the water being poured from one cup to another; the elements of life flowing together. Notice that the lower cup is not directly below the upper, so that the picture shows a physical impossibility. To other people the Temperate person’s ability to handle all life’s problems with joy appears magical. The Rider pact Temperance presents both cups as magical. In the Wirth picture on the right the upper one is silver, indicating a flow from the Moon, that is, the unconscious, to the Sun, consciousness. The second line began with a withdrawal from the world to find the inner self; the time has now come to return to the normal activities of life. The road especially signifies return. We have gone down into the self and now we are making our way back to involvement with the outer world, enriched. Notice that the two pillars of the earlier cards have become two mountains. Abstract ideas are becoming reality; Temperance is a card of behaviour, not concepts. The angel stands with one foot on land, one foot in water. As the water represents the unconscious so the land symbolizes the ‘real world’ of events and the other people. The Temperate personality, acting from an inner sense of life, links the two realms. The water also indicates potentiality, that is, the possibilities of life, while the land symbolizes manifestation or actuality. The Temperate person, through his or her actions, brings into reality the wonders sensed by the Hanged Man. The BOTA Temperance (see fig. 15b) shows water being poured on a lion, and a torch dripping flames on an eagle. Leo symbolizes fire (the Magician), while the eagle, the ‘higher’ form of Scorpio, stands for water (the High Priestess). The angel is mixing the basic duality, inseparably combining the different sides of life that previously appeared hopelessly alien to each other. Now, the eagle stands for the higher Scorpio because Scorpio represents the energy of the unconscious, As the lower form, the scorpion, this energy shows itself primarily as sexuality, the ‘animal desires’ of the undeveloped personality. When the energy has been transformed by channelling it through awareness it becomes the eagle of spirituality. Strength showed this energy brought out in the form of the lion; in the BOTA Temperance we see the process completed, the eagle and the lion combined. The angel resembles the Greek goddess Iris, whose sign was the rainbow; a rainbow appears on the BOTA card and iris flowers on the Rider pack version. Rainbows appear as a sign of peace after a storm, which reminds us that Temperance shows the personality released by the fearful experience of Death. The rainbow comes from water yet shines as light across the sky, an emblem of the inner self, which once seemed dark, chaotic, fearful, brought out and joyously transformed into the promise of new life. In Jewish and Christian tradition the rainbow is a sign of renewal after the Flood. The Flood, like Shiva's destruction of the universe, stands psychologically for the death of old patterns, which do not reflect the truth and joy of life and which lead people into ‘evil’ - behaviour destructive to themselves and to others. As Zeus’s messenger Iris travelled to the underworld to fill her golden cup with water from the River Styx. The Greeks believed that dead souls travelled across the Styx to the land of the dead. Only a descent into the underworld of the self can renew life* Religiously the angel symbolizes the immortal soul liberated by death. If you look closely below the collar you will see God’s name worked into the fabric of the gown. In Christian tradition the soul will become joined with God after the resurrection. The triangle within the square indicates that the Spirit rises from within the material body. Psychologically the angel indicates the energy of life which emerges after the ego’s Death. The triangle now shows that this energy works within the square of ordinary activities. We do not need to perform miracles to sense our connection with the immortal universe. We need only be ourselves.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "Temperance combines the elements of life. In reality it combines the elements of the personality, so that the person and the outer world will flow together naturally.",
    "upright_meaning": "The divinatory meanings, like the card’s ideas, begin with moderation, balance in all things and taking the middle path. The card means right action, doing the correct thing in whatever situation arises. Very often this means doing nothing. The intemperate person always needs to be doing something, but very often a situation requires a person to simply wait. The card will sometimes appear as an antidote to cards of recklessness and hysteria. Temperance signifies mixing disparate elements together, blending activities and feelings to produce a sense of harmony and peace. Because it means balancing and combining the different sides of life Temperance carries a special significance for the Minor Arcana. If a reading shows a person split between say, wands and cups, activity and passivity, or cups and pentacles, fantasy and reality, then Temperance, moderation and acting from an inner sense of life, can give a clue to bringing these things together.",
    "reversed_meaning": "Like the Fool reversed Temperance upside down indicates a wildness, going to extremes. In Temperance this is because the person lacks the inner awareness to know what is appropriate to a situation. The trump reversed can act as a warning that you have allowed your life to become fragmented and that you are sliding from one extreme to another. It can in fact indicate failure in the great task of letting old habits and fears die away into the past. On a simple level the reversed Temperance tells us to calm down and avoid extremes; in its deepest sense it sends us back to Strength to begin that long, sometimes painful, sometimes frightening, but always essentially joyous process of death and rebirth.",

    "description": "The Devil Why does this grim figure of oppression appear so late in the Tarot? After achieving the balance of Temperance why fall so abruptly? The Devil bears the number 15, which reduces to 6, the Lovers, and in fact, we can say that Waite worked backwards from the Devil when he designed his radical version of the Lovers. Thus in the Rider pack the Devil, with his captured demons, appears as a perversion of trump 6. But why the ‘true’ card so early and the perversion so near the end? The Devil introduces the last line. This hints that it provides some vital energy for the work of that line. Now, the line deals with archetypal forces beyond the self. Does the road to enlightenment take us through the dark world of the Devil? Remember that Dantg goes through Hell before he can reach Purgatory and Paradise; and that William Blake, the occultist and poet, described the Devil as the true hero of Milton’s moralist poem Paradise Lost. In order to understand the esoteric value of the Devil we must first consider its more usual meanings as a force of illusion and oppression. The main illusion is materialism, a term which we usually think of as an over concern with money, but which more properly means the view that nothing exists beyond the world of the senses. The Devil perches on a block of stone similar to the SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM Emperor’s cube in the BOTA deck. But where that cube symbolized the entire universe the Devil’s rectangle, half a cube, indicates a incomplete knowledge. Denying any spiritual component to life the materialist pursues only personal desires - monetary, sexual and political. Since such narrowness often leads to unhappiness the Devil has come to symbolize misery. When we look at the two figures, however, we do not observe any discomfort in their faces or posture. Notice also that the chains do not really hold them; the large loops can easily come off. The Devil’s power rests in the illusion that nothing else exists. In a great many situations, from political oppression to the personal misery of a bad family life, people only become consciously unhappy when they realize that life holds other alternatives. The Devil’s posture, one hand up, one down, recalls the Magician. Where trump 1 raises a wand to heaven, bringing down spiritual power, the Devil’s torch points to earth, signifying the belief that nothing exists beyond the material. The Devil’s palm bears the astrological glyph for Saturn, a planet often seen as symbolizing evil or misfortune, but more properly viewed as limitations, weaknesses or restrictions. The outspread fingers plus the number 5 in 15, recall the Hierophant’s two fingers up, two down. Where the latter gesture signified that there was more to the universe than what you can see before you, the Devil’s open palm indicates again that nothing exists beyond the obvious. The Devil wears a reversed pentacle, a symbol of black magic, on his forehead. Now, the pentacle carries a great many significances. If you stand with your feet apart and your arms out you will see that the pentacle symbolizes the human body. The right way up the head is uppermost and when we reverse the pentacle the genitals are above the head. In traditional Christian teaching the power of reason, the ability to tell right from wrong, rules the desires. Therefore, the reversed pentacle indicates letting your desires overpower your judgement. The Devil’s torch inflames the man’s tail, and people who experience their sexual needs as both over¬ powering and destructive have often described it as a fire burning inside them. The card’s background is black, symbolizing black magic, the inability to see the truth and depression. Thus we see the Devil’s traditional meanings: illusion, materialism, misery and sexual obsession. And yet, the card carries a great force. The Devil stares out at us intensely.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "The Devil implies a great deal more than sexual rites and violent energy. On a wider sense it symbolizes the life energy locked up in the dark hidden areas of the self, which cannot be entered by ordinary means. It is called the Devil because for those who are not prepared to receive this energy it can manifest itself as monsters, a sense of the universe as filled with evil, or the temptation to indulge in violence.",
    "upright_meaning": "In a reading the card appears out of context. The Devil can indicate a narrow materialistic view of life; it can mean any form of misery or depression, especially feeling chained or imprisoned, with the illusion that no alternatives are possible. If it appears in connection with the Lovers it shows that a relationship which began with love has turned into a trap. The Devil signifies being the slave of your desires, rather than acting the way you think is best. It can mean a controlling obsession, particularly a sexual one, where the person feels drawn to commit acts he or she finds morally repugnant. The extreme example is the sex criminal; on a much more common level many men and women find themselves powerfully attracted to people they actively dislike. The feeling of helplessness and shame which results from giving in to these desires belongs to the Devil.",
    "reversed_meaning": "The Devil reversed, on the other hand, indicates an attempt to break loose from some misery or bondage, either real or psychological. The person no longer accepts his or her situation and moves towards liberation. Paradoxically it is precisely at such a time that we feel our unhappiness and the limitations of our lives most strongly. Before you can slip off the chains you must become conscious of them. Therefore, people who are undergoing some process of liberation - say, leaving home, psychotherapy or a difficult divorce - often find themselves far more unhappy than when they blindly accepted their oppressed condition. Such a period can be crucial to a person’s development. If one can survive it, one will emerge happier and with a more developed personality. Sometimes we can find the period of transition unbearably painful and slip back to our chains. The Devil reversed in the position of the past often means that the change has occurred, but the feelings of sadness, of anger, of depression remain, perhaps hidden from conscious view, but still an influence.",

    "card_number": 16,
    "suit": "major",
    "arcana": "major",
    "description": "The Tower Like the Devil, this trump carries a great many meanings, and the explanations given by most Tarot books indicate its surface moral lessons. The Tower is said to be the materialist conception of the universe, and the lightning the destruction that comes to a life based on purely materialist principles. Even here we find a great deal of subtlety. While it may appear that some outside force strikes down the narrow-minded person, the violence shown in the card actually derives from psychological principles. The person who lives only to satisfy the ego demands of wealth, fame, and physical pleasure, ignoring both introspection and the spiritual beauty of the universe, raises a prison around himself. We see this person as the Tower; grey, rock-bound, with a gold crown. At the same time a pressure builds up inside the mind as the unconscious strains at its bonds. Dreams become disturbed, arguments and depression more common, and if a person represses these manifestations as well, the unconscious will often find some way to explode. The explosion may appear as an external disaster; your friends and family turn against you, your work collapses and violence of one kind or another swirls around you. And it is true that one of the mysteries of life is the way that bad luck comes in clusters. Yet, how many of these problems result from long neglected or mishandled THE GREAT JOURNEY situations, striking us at the moment we become vulnerable? And if some problems, illness or death of people close to us, economic problems in society, even natural disasters, such as storms - or lightning bolts - appear at the same time as personal problems, such coincidence shows again that life does indeed contain more than we can see in front of us. We should not think that the psyche, or life, brings on disaster simply to punish us. The drops of fire falling on each side of the Tower are shaped like the Hebrew letter yod, the first letter of God’s name. They symbolize not anger, but grace. The universe, and the human mind will not allow us to stay forever imprisoned in our towers of illusion and repression. If we cannot free ourselves peacefully then the forces of life will arrange an explosion. I do not mean to imply that we in any way enjoy the painful experiences that shake us loose, or that we can see the beneficial ends from such means, or even that the process always results in freedom. Very often a series of disasters or a period of violent emotions will cripple a once strong personality. The point is only that given no other outlets the unconscious will erupt all around us, and that we can use this experience to find a better balance. Some decks call this card ‘The House of the Devil’; but others call it ‘The House of God’, reminding us that it is spiritual force which destroys our psychic prisons. There is a deeper meaning in the linking of God’s and the Devil’s houses, a meaning implied even more directly in the fact that the Hebrew for ‘snake’ bears the same numerical value (and is therefore seen as equivalent to) the word for ‘messiah’. The Devil is God’s shadow. In trump 15 we saw that the person seeking unity with life must bring out the energy normally repressed by the conscious personality. By embracing the Devil, however, we endanger that calm and balance shown in Temperance. We set the psyche on a violent course leading to the explosion of the Tower. Jung described consciousness as a dam blocking free flow of the river of the unconscious. Temperance acts as a kind of sluice, letting the waters through at a controlled rate. The Tower blows away the dam completely, releasing the locked up energy as a flood. Why take such a dangerous course? The answer is that no other way exists to finally go beyond the barrier of consciousness, or to break free from that which separates life into opposites and which cuts us off from the pure energy contained within ourselves. The veil across the temple is the conscious personality, protecting us from life itself. As mystics, shamans, and ecstatics have testified, eternity is all around us, blinding and overwhelming. The unprepared mind cannot encompass such power, and so consciousness comes to our SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM rescue, closing off the major part of our spiritual energy, parcelling experience into time and opposing categories. The mystics tell us as well that revelation comes as a lightning bolt which destroys the illusions of the material world in a single blinding flash, like that seen by Paul on his way to Damascus, or that which struck Buddha under the Bo tree. No matter how long the meditation, the years of prayer or occult training, the truth comes all at once or it does not come at all. Which is not to say that the preparation was meaningless. The work shown in the first two lines of the Major Arcana serves a double purpose. Not only does it make us strong enough to withstand the lightning when it comes, it also puts us in a position to bring about the bolt of revelation, that a person can take definite steps to make this happen. These steps include the teaching, the meditations, the ego death, and finally the embracing of the Devil. By releasing that energy we get past the barriers of repression and open ourselves to the lightning. For the spirit exists all the time; it is we who are blind to it. By going into the darkness of the self we open ourselves to the light. Obviously, this is a dangerous process. The unprepared person can become trapped in the illusions of the Devil. We will see also that the release of energy carries its own dangers as the psyche tries to integrate it with the conscious awareness. The hero on the way back from the centre of the labyrinth can become lost if he has not carefully prepared himself. The Tower comes below the High Priestess, for it shows the veil being ripped away. At the same time the lightning recalls the Magician. That energy and truth which passes through the Magician here strikes in full force. We also see trumps 1 and 2 in the two people; one in blue, the other in a red cloak. The polarity symbolized in so many of the earlier cards is here overwhelmed by the unity of existence. Count the yod drops of fire and you will find that they come to twenty-two, the number of trumps. You will find also that they are separated into ten and twelve. The Sumerians used a number system based on ten (for ten fingers) for worldly matters, but a separate system based on twelve, for the zodiac, for spiritual counting. This duality is also an illusion. Both worlds are manifestations of the same spirit fire. . The image of a destroyed tower brings to mind the tower of Babel. On a literal level that story explains why people speak so many languages, while morally it teaches us not to put our faith in human abilities (the Tower as materialism). But we can see another THE GREAT JOURNEY meaning in Babel’s destruction. The lightning that struck it was God speaking directly to humanity rather than indirectly through the ordinary phenomena of the physical world. In an instant the speech of God replaces the human speech that built the tower; revelation replaces the step by step knowledge of the senses. Remember that the descent of the spirit at Pentecost scrambles human language; people ‘speak in tongues’ or make animal noises. And the shamans in their trances speak the languages of the beasts and birds. Human language is an aspect of culture and a limitation of consciousness. Many linguists, notably Benjamin Whorf, have demonstrated that our languages restrict our ability to perceive reality, like a filter over the universe. And truth, the mystics tell us, cannot be expressed in words. The Tower’s 16 reduces to 7, the Chariot, linked by Case and others to human speech. The speech of God of the Tower destroys in a moment all the careful constructions of culture, language and consciousness. In so doing it returns us to the chaos of the sea beneath the Wheel of Fortune and the Pool of water behind the veil of the Priestess. In some ways the Tower is the most complex of all the trumps; its more subtle meanings are at odds with its obvious ones. Like the Devil its divinatory meanings usually derive from the obvious. It usually refers to a period of violent upheaval (either literally or psychologically), the destruction of long established situations, the break-up of relationships in anger or even violence. Because the card carries such furious significance many people recoil at the sight of it. The reaction raises the vital question of how to regard the Tarot’s more fearful images. We must learn to use all experience, the Tower as well as the Lovers. When the Tower appears it is necessary to remember that it can lead to freedom; the explosions are clearing away some situation that has built up intolerable pressure. They can lead to new beginnings. To say that the Tower’s appearance usually signifies difficult experience is not to insist that the deeper meanings will never arise. The card can mean a flash of enlightenment, particularly if such enlightenment replaces a limited view of life.",

When reversed, then, the card means that we do not allow ourselves to undergo the full experience. By keeping a tight control on our reactions we lessen the pain; we also do not release all the repressed material. Within ourselves the painful experience continues, never having gone its full course. By shielding the Tower from the lightning we become its prisoners.",

    "description": "The Star After the storm, peace. The person who undergoes emotional upheaval finds afterward a sense of calm and emptiness. Lay the cards out for someone who has never seen them and the Star will hardly need interpretation. Everything in it speaks of wholeness, openness, and healing. It is worth comparing the Star with Temperance, where we also see a figure pouring water and holding two cups, with one foot on land and one in water. Both cards come after a crisis, but where Temperance is controlled the Star is free. Not clothed, but naked. Not standing stiffly, but supple and relaxed. And finally, where Temperance pours the water back and forth, blending but at the same time conserving, the Star maiden pours it out freely, confident that life will continually supply her with new energy. The picture suggests all those mythical chalices that could never be emptied. The Tower’s release of energy ripped away the veil of Ill THE GREAT JOURNEY consciousness. Here in the Star we are behind the veil. The pool of water, small though it is, represents the unconscious; that same water we saw concealed behind the pillars of the High Priestess. Now this universal life energy has been stirred up by the act of pouring the person’s own life waters into it. The water being poured onto land indicates that the energy freed by the Tower is directed outwards as well as inwards; it links the unconscious with the outer reality of the physical world. One way to describe the streams of water is as the archetypes of myth, the images through which the unconscious expresses itself. The unconscious is a whole, without shape or division, but it emerges into awareness through the separate streams of mythology. With the Star we have gone beyond myth to its source as formless energy; as light coming out of darkness. The transformation of darkness into light is the unconscious, the hidden vastness within us, changed into the ecstatic awareness of super-consciousness. One stream of water flows back into the pool, signifying that all archetypes blend back into the formless truth. The value of the archetype lies only in its power to arouse the inner self and to connect us to the source. The maiden’s foot does not penetrate the water. The collective unconscious has not been entered, but only stirred up. • The bird on the right is an ibis, a symbol of the Egyptian god Thoth, who was considered the inventor of all arts, from poetry to pottery. Literally he taught the first artists their techniques, but on a more symbolic level, we can say that all creative action stems originally from the pool of unformed energy. It is one function of being a physical creature that we take this energy and use it to make poems, paintings and tapestries. All these human creations are symbolized in those several streams of water. Every act of creation objectifies spiritual energy in the thing created. At the same time no work exhausts the artist’s inspiration as long as he or she remains connected to the inner sources. Therefore, the one stream returns to the pool, just as each work gives its creator new inspiration. The Star appears below the Empress and the Wheel. In the Empress we saw the natural world glorified in the passions. But the Empress was heavily clothed to indicate that she expresses her emotion through things outside herself- nature, lovers and children. In the Star we see the inner self joyfully experiencing itself. The Star maiden combines the two female archetypes, the inner sensitivity of the High Priestess brought out and expressed with the passion of the Empress. In the Wheel of Fortune we saw a vision of the universe in SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM mysterious symbols. Here the Tower has taken us beyond visions. In the Star we directly experience the unconscious, rather than its images. As trump 17 the Star goes beyond 7, with the Star releasing the life force that the Chariot controlled and directed. 1 plus 7 equals 8, and we can see that the Star is Strength raised to a higher level, with the lion of desire no longer simply tamed, but transformed into light and joy. The stars on the card are all eight pointed which is another reference to Strength. Since an eight pointed star can be formed by placing one square over another with the points alternating, the octogram is sometimes thought of as halfway between the square and the circle. The square stands for matter and the circle for spirit. Human beings are the link between the spirit and the physical world; our ability to both feel the truth, and to act, makes us vehicles through which the truth can manifest itself. The Church used to describe humans as halfway between the animals and the angels. Usually a moral interpretation was given; people could follow their desires or their reason. But we can use this metaphor to say that human awareness and action connect the physical world to the ‘angels’. Despite all the suggestions of manifestations the Star is not really a card of action, but of inner calm. In contrast to Temperance and the Moon, the Star shows no road leading back from the pool to the mountains of outer reality. Though the streams and the ibis imply the uses of creative energy, the experience of the Star is one of peace. For the moment, the journey can wait.",

    "upright_meaning": "In divinatory readings the card expresses hope, a sense of healing and wholeness, especially after emotional storms. Very often the Star and the Tower suggest each other even when only one actually appears. Trump 17 indicates the unconscious activated, but in a very benign way.",
    "reversed_meaning": "Reversed, we close ourselves off from the card’s calm and hope, experiencing weakness, impotence, and fear. This deep insecurity can sometimes mask itself as arrogance. If the Star indicates the human as a link between the spirit and the outer world then the card reversed symbolizes the channels closed, and when the waters of life are dammed up inside, the outside can only become tired and depressed.",

    "description": "The true task of the third line is not revelation but bringing that inner ecstasy back to consciousness. The Star contained no road back. It shows us dwelling in the glories of darkness transformed into light. To use that light we must pass through distortion and fear. The Star experience lies beyond words or even form, though it implies forms emerging with the streams of water. In the Moon we see this process happening, as visions, myths and images. The Moon is the card of the imagination as it molds the energy of the Star into shapes that the consciousness can comprehend. Myths are always distorted. They can never really say what they want, they can only appeal to things deep within the self. The Star stirred up the waters; as we return to outer awareness those waters give forth their creatures. Remember that the Star and the Sun give off their own light, but the Moon reflects the hidden light of the Sun. The imagination distorts because it is reflecting inner experience to the outer mind. As the world’s mythologies demonstrate the collective unconscious contains monsters as well as heros, fear as well as joy. This is one reason why we cover our sensitivity to life with the protective layer of ego consciousness, so we will no longer fear the dark and the distorting shadows of the Moon. The Moon’s eerie half-light has always brought out strange feelings in people and animals. One word for madness, ‘lunacy’, derives from ‘luna’, Latin for moon, and in the Middle Ages people believed that the souls of the insane had flown off to the moon. Today, too, many doctors and police have observed the prevalence of suicides and other signs of disturbed emotions during the full moon. Something about the moon excites fear and strangeness, just as the sun relaxes and consoles us. The Tarot Sun comes after the Moon; simplicity can only be appreciated after a journey through the lunar strangeness. The dog and the wolf represent the ‘animal self’ roused by the Moon, just as a full moon can set both creatures howling all night long. The Emperor, directly above trump 18, showed us learning the rules of society so well that they become automatic. With the last line we go beyond this ‘super ego’ repression; in the process the ‘id’ wildness comes to the surface. A werewolf howling under a full moon is a vivid metaphor of the power of the unconscious to bring out something primitive and non-human in the most respectable people. As 18 the Moon relates to 8. Strength saw the animal nature tamed, and channelled through the Hermit. Here no such direction is given; as we come back from the Star the beast returns in all its wildness. Only when the Star energy is fully integrated in the World will the animal self be wholly transformed. Notice that in Strength the woman, the human side, controls the lion. Even in the Devil the demons appear clearly human. But there are no people on trump 18. In that half-light our sense of ourselves as human breaks down. We sense something of the Moon’s wildness in the aftermath of a nightmare, when we feel strange within ourselves. The wild sensations are not the result of the nightmare; it is more the other way around. We said earlier that dreams are transformations of unconscious energy into images. A burst of energy which is too great for the dream mechanisms to peacefully assimilate can result in both a nightmare and the feeling when you wake up of the body being charged with wild energy. Madness is also accompanied by uncontrolled sensations in the body. Very often lunacy takes the form of transformation into an animal. People will crawl on all fours, naked, howling at the moon. A sudden release of unconscious energy has disintegrated the personality. In the Tarot this very dangerous moment happens only after long preparation, with all the normal ego problems left behind. The shaman too experiences a transformation into a beast. Shamans will leap about and speak as animals during their trances. But the shaman, like the occultist, has prepared himself with years of preparation. He is also armed with the knowledge of what to expect, handed down from the generations of shamans who have gone before. Remember that the Moon’s number adds up to 9, the Hermit. The teacher-guide of that card is not visible, for we must face the Moon alone, but the guidance given beforehand can help us find our way. If the animals symbolize the savage in man, the crayfish is something very different. In one of his most vivid phrases Waite calls it ‘that which lies deeper than the savage beast’. It symbolizes the most universal fears within the collective unconscious, experienced in visions as nameless demons. The emergence of such terrors is a well known occurrence to people who expose their lunar side through such methods as deep meditation or drugs. They are also seen as monsters encountered by shamans on their trance journeys. The arousal of these fears, often experienced as creatures emerging from water or pools of oily liquid, can produce unreasoning panic. Yet these images belong to our inner world; we cannot reach the Sun without passing them. The crayfish half emerges from the water. Waite tells us it never comes completely onto land but always falls back again. The deepest errors are the ones that never fully take shape. We feel something inside, but we can never see just what it is. At the same time the half emerging crayfish suggests that in the journey back to consciousness the deep perceptions of the Star become distorted because we cannot bring it all back. For this reason too the Moon is disturbing, because the peace and wonder of the Star have become partially destroyed and lost. And yet, despite the wildness, the fearful excitement, the cool light can calm as well. The Moon is said to increase on the ‘side of mercy’, a reference to the pillar of mercy on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Even more striking, the drops of light falling on the animals’ heads are, again, yods; the first letter of God’s name and symbols of grace. If, through preparation and simple courage, we accept the wild things brought out by the deepest imagination, then the Moon brings peace, the terrors subside, and the imagination leads us back, enriched, with its wonders. Waite writes, ‘Peace, be still; and there shall come a calm upon the waters.’ The crayfish sinks back, the waters settle. The road remains. The road leads through two towers, suggesting a gateway into unknown areas. The gateway is a very common symbol among mystics and shamans, seen also in many myths. Sometimes a circular pattern, like the mandala, or some physical formation, like a cave (very often compared to the vagina), the gateway allows us to leave the ordinary world to enter the strangeness of the mind. The Tarot’s two towers carry another meaning, as the last complete manifestation of that duality we first saw in the pillars of the High Priestess’s temple. If the revelation of the Tower is not integrated with ordinary life then a new and more acute duality may result. At the same time, the very fact of having heard the speech of God totally changes our relation to the question of opposites. Previously duality was seen as basic to life, but we now know that in fact reality combines all things; where before the veil kept us from passing between the two pillars, here we have already passed through. We are looking at the two towers of consciousness from the other side. The task is not to pierce through to the inner truth but to take back that truth.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "",
    "upright_meaning": "In divinatory readings the Moon indicates an excitement of the unconscious. We begin to experience strange emotions, dreams, fears, even hallucinations. If the card appears the right way up then the person will allow this to happen. When accepted, the imagination enriches life.",
    "reversed_meaning": "But if the card appears reversed, it shows a struggle against the experience. This struggle leads to fear and often very disturbed emotions as the person does not allow the Moon’s calming side to emerge. Like the High Priestess the Moon indicates turning away from outer concerns and becoming introspective. It can indicate giving up some specific activity or simply a period of withdrawal. However, whilst the High Priestess symbolizes quiet intuition, the Moon is excited, stimulating images from the unconscious. Again, the Moon reversed signifies a disturbance. The person does not wish to turn away from the solar side, and may try to fight off the Moon by a great deal of activity. The Moon, however, will not be denied, and the fears can get stronger the more we fight it. The psyche, operating under its own laws for its own reasons, has turned to the Moon. If we allow ourselves to experience it the fears will turn to wonders and the gateways open to adventure.",

    "description": "The Sun Like the Hanged Man above it the Sun is both a joyful release after the test shown in the previous card and a preparation for the death and rebirth in the two cards following. Justice required action as a response to the knowledge gained about ourselves. As a result the Hanged Man is passive. The Moon requires passive surrender, since there is no way we can control the visions rising under its influence. Therefore, the Sun shows an active, energized state. By accepting the Moon’s fearful images we bring the energy outside ourselves, giving all of life a radiance. Under the Sun everything becomes simple, joyous and physical. The light of the unconscious brought into daily life. The two children in the Oswald Wirth version, on the right, above the more common image for the trump, are sometimes called the eternal self and the mortal body. Holding hands, they have joined together. The two figures with the Sun above them returns us to the triangular motif first seen in the Hierophant two lines above. Here the joy and simplicity of the Sun does not mediate between the inner and outer poles of life but joins them together. We are all children, in the way that sun religions speak of us all as holy children of our father, the sun. If you look at the bodies, in the picture, especially the female, you will see that they are adults. The successful passage from the Tower has given them a childlike simplicity. The Tarot shows this passage in its various stages, giving the impression of the passage of time. Sometimes, however, perhaps most often, it happens all at once, the blinding revelation of the Tower, the inner radiance of the Star, and the acute fear of the Moon, all joined in a single instant of transformation. And the aftermath is joy, a sense of all life and all the world being filled with a wondrous light. Among all people enlightenment bears the same characteristics, whatever the cultural interpretation through mythology, doctrine, psychological theory, etc. Enlightenment is an experience, not an idea. The person feels struck by a burst of light, sometimes coloured, like the yod drops in the Wirth card. Suddenly the world is seen or felt, as spiritual and eternal, rather than the day to day existence of drudgery and confusion. The person feels totally alive with a childlike joy that, in fact, most children probably never know, for the sunstruck person has gone beyond the child’s fear of darkness by travelling through it. In its journey across the world the sun sees everything, and so represents knowledge. Gods associated with the sun, like Apollo, are said to know everything that happens. The sunstruck person feels a sense of wisdom, of seeing everything with total clarity. He or she is ‘lucid’, a word which means clear and direct, but which literally means ‘filled with light’. It is interesting that Apollo, god of light, was born from Leto, goddess of night, and that his major shrine, the oracle at Delphi, belonged originally to goddesses of darkness. Even under Apollo’s direction the wisdom and light of the oracle operated out of darkness. It was Apollo who forced Oedipus to discover the mystery within himself. The spring sun brings forth life out of the dead winter ground. In many places it was believed that the sun impregnates not only the soil, but all women. When the biological means of reproduction was discovered the role of the sun was not dropped but made more subtle. People now saw the soul - the atman or true self - as sunlight contained within the embryo. Buddhist myth states that Gautama, in his mother’s womb, was all light so that her belly shone like a translucent screen over a powerful lamp. Zoroaster too blazed so powerfully in his mother’s womb that the neighbours ran with buckets, thinking the house had caught fire. The Gnostics carried this idea further, believing that the Fall had broken up the godhead into the bits and pieces of existence. Most important, the light had become imprisoned (rather than simply contained) in individual bodies. It was each person’s duty, through the Gnostic rites, to release the light within his body so that unity could be restored. The Qabalist Isaac Luria preached a similar doctrine. The Tree of Life, or Adam Kadmon, the unity of existence, had been shattered because the god light was too powerful for it. Again, the light became separated and imprisoned, so that it was the responsibility of each person to aid in ‘tikkun’, that is, restoration of the light to unity. These doctrines derive from the Sun experience common to all cultures. The sunstruck person sees everything, each person, each animal, all the plants and rocks, even the very air, alive and holy, united through the light that fills all existence. And yet, the Sun is not the World. With trump 19 we perceive the universe as unified and alive. 21 embodies those feelings. The usual drawing for the Sun shows the children within a garden, often standing in a circle. Douglas calls this the ‘inner garden of the soul’, a feeling of purity and holiness, a new Garden of Eden. When we liberate and transform the energy locked inside us we find that the Garden of Eden was never really lost, but has always existed within us. The Rider pack shows its single child riding out of a garden. For Waite the Sun experience was essentially a burst of freedom. It was a breaking loose, a wonderful liberation from ordinary restricted consciousness to openness and freedom. The grey, stone wall in the picture represents the past life, bound by a narrow perception of reality. The super-consciousness of the Sun is characterized by feeling a part of the whole world rather than an isolated individual. We can perhaps combine the two images for the trump by saying that once you realize that the Garden of Eden exists within you, you are free to leave it, taking it with you always as you create a new life.",

    "description": "Judgement Under the Sun we see all of life as filled with spiritual light. This awareness of eternal truth frees us from all illusion and fear so that now we feel, like a call from deep inside, the urge to dissolve ourselves completely into the spirit and wondrous life contained in every being. This call comes from both inside and outside us, for one of the effects of the Sun was to break down the artificial barrier between inner experience and the outer world. We feel the call in our deepest selves as if the very cells of the body were filled with a shout of joy. THE GREAT JOURNEY 121 At the same time, we recognize that the call comes from some force greater than any individual life. This idea of Judgement as a call to rise to a more meaningful existence has its analogues in more ordinary situations. Sometimes in life a person can come to a crossroads (notice the cross in the banner) where a decision is required on whether to make some great change. And sometimes it can seem as if something within the person has already decided and the only choice left to the conscious self is to follow with the appropriate action. The old ways of believing and thinking, the old situations, have died without ourselves even noticing. Most versions of the trump show only the angel and the figures rising up. The Rider pack adds a range of mountains in the background. Waite calls them the ‘mountains of abstract thought’. The term implies eternal truth beyond the limited knowledge available to us through ordinary means. One of the basic features of morality is the inability to know anything in an absolute sense. We are bound by our short lives and by the fact that all knowledge comes to our minds through the medium of the senses. In modern physics we learn that scientific investigation can never form an exact picture of reality because the observer is always a part of the universe that he or she is observing. In the same way, each person’s thoughts about and perceptions of life are influenced by that person’s past experience. ‘Abstract thought’ implies, like the Platonic ideals, a sense of the absolute. W'e reach this ‘abstraction’ by making one last descent into the waters of nothingness in order to rise up liberated from all partial knowledge. Death, directly above, showed a dissolution. There the ego was dying and the trump emphasized the fear of letting go. Here all illusions of isolation are dissolved, and the emphasis rests not on the death but on the resurrection. We call the card Judgement because, like Justice, it involves coming to terms with past experience as a part of going beyond it. With Justice the experience and the response were personal, based on your actions in the past. Here a force greater than yourself is leading and calling you, and the Judgement is not simply on the meaning of your own life but on the true nature of existence, and the way in which you and all beings are a part of it. At times in this book we have referred to the Hebrew letters assigned to the different trumps. Usually we have followed the system in which the Fool is Aleph. There is another system, where the Magician receives Aleph, and in that system Judgement bears the letter Resh. Resh means ‘head’ and refers, like Waite’s mountains, to the true mind awakened by the call. Resh also SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM suggests Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, literacy ‘head of the year’. Now, Rosh Hashanah is not the start of the calendar, like the secular New Year, but represents, in fact, the anniversary of creation. Similarly, Judgement indicates not a change of circumstances but a new consciousness, one directly acquainted with the truth through a merging of yourself with the forces of life. The Wheel of Fortune, with its invisible laws of psychic cause and effect, was 10; Judgement is 20, 10 multiplied by 2. Through the workings of the last line we reveal the High Priestess’s hidden wisdom so that now we understand the inner mysteries concealed in the Wheel. The cross in the banner indicates a meeting of opposites, a joining of all the things that had been separated. It symbolizes a meeting of two kinds of time; the ordinary time we perceive with our senses and by which we live from day to day, and eternity, the spiritual perception of life. These two times are symbolized by the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross. Their meeting in the centre indicates that the higher self does not abandon its old activities but goes about them in a new way. The card above Judgement is the Lovers and, in the Rider pack, also shows an angel. There, however, the angel was a glimpse of a greater truth experienced through the medium of love. Here the angel leans down from the cloud to call to us. In the traditional version of the Sun we saw the final example of that triangular motif begun in trumps 5 and 6. Here we see a child between the two people. The poles of life have come together to form a new reality, in the way that every child is both a combination of its parents and something completely new. The child in front stands with his back to us. The new existence is a mystery, with no way for us to know what it will be like until we experience it. The child’s hidden face also implies that we do not really know ourselves, and that we cannot until we hear and respond to the call. Virtually all mythologies contain stories of the hero separated from his parents and raised as an ordinary child, with other people, and very often the child himself, knowing nothing of his true identity. King Arthur, Moses, Theseus, and Christ all follow this pattern. We see this same idea in many science fiction stories, where the hero awakes in a strange place with no memory; his search for his true identity leads him to discover great powers within himself. Very often he finds himself in the centre of either a powerful plot or at the very workings of nature. We have all ‘forgotten’ our true identities and have become separated from our ‘parents’. And when we find or create our true selves, we will find ourselves at the centre of the universe. For the centre is everywhere. THE GREAT JOURNEY 123 Most decks show only the three people in the foreground. Waite’s addition of three more people, all facing us, suggests that while Judgement leads to the unknown, there is still an awareness (also symbolized as well by the mountains) of the ways in which the unknown life will develop. The extra people imply another, very vital point. By showing a whole group rising the trump reminds us that there is no personal liberation. Each human being is part of the human race and therefore responsible for the development of the race as a whole. No one can be truly free while someone else is enslaved. Buddha was said to have come back as a boddhisatva because he understood that he could not liberate himself until he had liberated all humanity. At the same time, any single liberation liberates everybody. This is because any person’s attainment of Judgement and the World alter the circumstances of everybody’s life. Gautama’s Buddahood and the resurrection of Christ are seen as events that have totally changed the world.",
    "symbolic_meaning": "Judgement indicates not a change of circumstances but a new consciousness, one directly acquainted with the truth through a merging of yourself with the forces of life.",
    "upright_meaning": "In the divinatory readings the card of Judgement carries a special significance. Whatever else is going on around you, there is a push, a call from within, to make some important change. The change can refer to something mundane and immediate, or to an entire shift in the way a person looks at life - depending on the other cards, and the subject of the reading. The important thing is the call. In effect, the person has already changed; the old situations, the old self, have already died. It is simply a matter of recognizing it.",
    "reversed_meaning": "Judgement reversed can indicate that the person wishes to answer the call but does not know what to do. More often it shows someone trying to deny the call, usually from a fear of the unknown. There may, in fact, be a great many rational reasons why the person should not follow the suggested change: lack of money, lack of preparation or responsibilities. Judgement, the right way up or reversed, indicates that all the objections are excuses. When the card is upside down the excuses become dominant; the person remains standing in the grave. The word Judgement implies that the reality of life has changed. The only choice is to follow.",

    "description": "The World What can we say of an understanding, a freedom and rapture beyond words? The unconscious known consciously, the outer self unified with the forces of life, knowledge that is not knowledge at all but a constant ecstatic dance of being - they are all true and yet not true. We have already observed a great deal about this card and its images. The number as well as the two wands unify the Magician and the High Priestess. We saw the World foreshadowed as well in the Wheel of Fortune, and reflected how the symbols of that trump are now living realities. One way or another, the Wheel has come up for virtually every card in the last line. The purpose of this line can be described as that of uniting ourselves with all those things seen in trump 10 as external vision, that is, fate, the workings of life, the elements of existence. When the unity is achieved the symbols vanish, dissolved into a dancing spirit. We saw the World in the Hanged Man, by number and picture. Trump 12 maintained its bliss through complete inactivity. But even the World Tree is an illusion created by the mind’s need to grasp onto something. When we have dissolved our isolated selves into that water lying beneath the Hanged Man’s glowing face we learn that true unity lies in movement. THE GREAT JOURNEY Everything in the universe moves, the Earth around the sun, the sun within the galaxy, the galaxies in clusters, all cycling around each other. There is no centre, no place where we can say, ‘Here it all began, here it all stops.’ Yet the centre exists, everywhere, for in a dance the dancer does not move around any arbitrary point in space, but rather the dance carries its own sense of unity focused around a constantly moving, constantly peaceful centre. Nothing and everything all at once. And so we return to the Fool. Innocence and emptiness, united with wisdom. As we said at the beginning, of all the Major Arcana cards, only these two are moving. The oval wreath suggests the number 0, with all its symbolism. It implies as well the cosmic egg, the archetype of emergence; all things exist in potential and all potentials are realized. The self is everywhere in all things. The sashes at the top and bottom of the wreath are tied into infinity signs, indicating that the self is not enclosed but open to the universe. The sashes are red, the colour of the root chakra in Kundalini symbolism. The dancer has not lost her physical being, her root in material, sexual reality. Instead, the energy is constantly flowing, transformed and renewed. The green of the wreath symbolizes the natural world raised up rather than abandoned. Green is also the colour of love and healing, radiating wholeness to everyone, even those who are not consciously aware of it. Purple (the banner) is the colour of divinity and blue (the sky) the colour of communication. When we know that divinity is not something out there, but within ourselves, then our very presence communicates this truth to those around us. One of the World’s analogues is Shiva, Lord of the Cosmic Dance. He too dances with the arms out, one foot down and the other raised, the head balanced and the expression calm. The right foot of both figures is ‘planted’ in the physical world, while the raised left leg symbolizes the soul’s release. When we become most joined to life, at that moment we realize our freedom. The face is neither sad nor joyful but at peace, free in its emptiness. The arms are open to all experience. , Dancing Shiva is usually depicted as an hermaphrodite, one half of the body Shiva, the other Parvati, his female side. The World dancer is also hermaphroditic, the dual sexual organs concealed by the banner, as if to say th^t the unity they represent lies beyond our knowing. In discussing the Lovers we referred to the widespread belief that all people were originally hermaphrodites. The dancer expresses and unites all the different sides of being. The same feeling that leads us to a ‘memory’ of primeval hermaphroditism has taken people a step further to the image of the entire universe having once been a single human being. We find this belief among the Gnostics, in Blake, in German, Indian, and other mythologies, and in great detail in the Qabalah. There the figure bears the name ‘Adam Kadmon’ and is said to be the original creation emanating from the unknowable God. Rather than a physical being, Adam Kadmon, also hermpahroditic, was described as pure light. Only when the figure broke up into the separate parts of the universe did the light become ‘imprisoned’ in matter. It is a fascinating fact that the contemporary scientific theories of cosmogony describe the universe as originally one particle. At the moment that the particle broke up it was all pure light; only later, as the pieces became more isolated did some of that energy condense into matter, following Einstein’s famous formulation, E=mc 2 . The myths consider the break-up of primeval Man an irreversible event. Occultists, however, believe in the possibility of restoration. By following the process outlined in the Major Arcana we become united with life and so ourselves become Adam Kadmon and Shiva- Parvati. Adam Kadmon it linked to the Tree of Life, with its ten sephiroth, or points of emanation. We have already seen the connection between this figure and the Tarot through the Tree’s 22 paths. The World Dancer, by her posture, is an exact representation of the Tree of Life’s most common form. The Tree is drawn in the following way: O-O O O O O Very simplified, the top triangle is super-consciousness, the middle is consciousness, the bottom the unconscious, and the final point, the root of the Tree, is the manifestation of all these principles in the physical world. In the Dancer the top triangle is the crown of the head and the points of the shoulders, the middle triangle is the hands and the genitals, the bottom triangle is the crossed leg and right foot. At the same time it is all one body. By contemplating the dancer we learn that the unconscious, conscious and super-conscious are not separate parts or even separate stages of being, but are all one. But what about the tenth sephira, the root of the Tree? We find it not in the body but in all the universe, the wonderful ground of being in which we move. Descriptions, metaphors, even contemplation can only hint at the wonders embodied in trump 21.",

    "description": "A King is a ruler, responsible for the welfare of society. In the Rider pack all four Kings wear what Waite calls ‘a cap of maintenance’ underneath their crowns. Traditionally the king bears responsibility for maintaining his people. Therefore, all the Kings represent both success (for the king, after all, is supreme) and social responsibility. The King of Wands translates these qualities into Wands terms. He indicates a strong-minded person, able to dominate others by strength of will. His power derives from a firm belief in his own rightness. He knows the truth; he knows his method is best. He considers it only natural for others to follow him. At the same time he shows the Wands energy controlled and turned into useful projects, or long-term careers. The adventurous Wands nature can make such a person uncomfortable in this role. He leans forward on his throne, as if he would like to leap up and go to seek new experience. He is naturally honest, seeing no reason or value in lies. He is positive and optimistic for much the same reason; the Wands energy burns so strongly in him he does not understand why anyone would express negative attitudes. Such a strong personality can tend towards intolerance, unable to understand weakness or despair because he has not experienced these things himself. This impatient side of the King might bear the motto, ‘If I can do it you can’. Once, in a reading, I saw a very nice expression of what people used to call ‘the generation gap’: the King of Wands and the Fool, both of them energetic, yet one the essence of responsibility, the other the pure image of instinct and freedom. Two symbols dominate the card: the lion, emblem of Leo, and the salamander, a legendary lizard believed to inhabit fire. They represent the mundane and the spiritual, for while Leo indicates the personality traits belonging to Fire, the salamander was a favourite symbol of the alchemists. At his best the King is master of the creative Fire. His sense of social commitment has tamed it and put it to use. Notice that the salamanders on his robe are shown with their tails in their mouths. The closed circle means maturity and completion.",

    "reversed_meaning": "When we reverse a card we alter in some way its prime meaning, as if the original impact had become blocked or rechannelled, or, in some cases, liberated. Some Tarot commentators prefer to discount reversed meanings, and it is true that in meditation or creativity we usually consider all cards as right side up. But in readings or study reversed meanings do more than double the possible meanings in the deck. By showing us the card from a different angle they give us a wider understanding of what the card really means. In a reading, if a court card refers to a specific person (by physical type, say, rather than the card’s qualities), then reversed indicates that person disturbed or blocked, or maybe having a bad influence on the subject. If, on the other hand, we look at the qualities in the card then reversed shows those qualities altered. Right side up the King shows us someone powerful and commanding, yet often intolerant of other people’s weaknesses. Reversed we see that natural fire after it has encountered obstacles and defeats that might make a less forceful person cynical or frightened. Because he is the King of Wands he does not lose his force but becomes instead tempered, more understanding of others and at the same time harsher in his attitude to life, which no longer appears such an easy contest. Waite's formula here is very apt: ‘Good but severe, austere yet tolerant.’",

Once again, we need not apply these qualities only to women. If, in a reading, we see the Queen as identifying a person by physical type alone, then the Queen naturally means a woman. But if we wish to apply the symbolic qualities to someone, then any court card can signify a woman or a man. And apart from readings the Queen of Wands stands for a particular appreciation of life. In contrast with the King's eagerness and impatience, the Queen sits on her throne as if planted there. Her crown is flowering, her dress is sunshine. Alone of all the Queens she sits with her legs apart, signifying sexual energy. She shows a Fire appreciation of life, warm, passionate, very solidly in the world. Like the King, she is honest and sincere, seeing no purpose in deceit or nastiness. More sensitive than the King she allows herself to love both life and other people, seeing control or dominance as of no more value than cynicism. A black cat guards her throne. In Christian folklore the Devil gave a black cat to a witch to guard her from attack. The WANDS meaning here is less melodramatic.

His Wands eagerness has involved him in so many situations that now, paradoxically, that very energy is weighed down with commitments and problems. He wants to be free to travel, to seek adventure and new involvements; but instead he finds himself, like the suburban career man, caught in a net of endless responsibilities - financial, family, work - that he himself has created.

But these situations and responsibilities do not go away when the person becomes bored and wants to go on to something new. They remain and can swamp the fire that seemed to conquer them. In emotional situations the card shows us the person who takes on himself or herself all the weight of a relationship. Whatever problems arise, conflicts and dissatisfaction, he or she tries to smooth them over. With bent back she or he struggles to keep the relationship going, while the other person(s) may not even recognize what is happening. In both the practical and the emotional situation the person has taken the burdens on her or himself. He or she has made the situation and needs to realize that other approaches are still possible. In such situations the burdens may not be wholly real, or at least may be avoided; they may in fact serve as an excuse to avoid doing anything really constructive such as breaking away from a bad situation.",

In a reading we can determine the best meaning (though sometimes more than one meaning will apply, as with a choice) partly through the other cards, and partly through an intuition that can only develop with practice. In study this variety of meanings demonstrates the fact that a situation can change in many ways. Most simply the Ten of Wands reversed indicates that the burdens have increased in weight and number to the point where the person may collapse from them, physically or emotionally. At the same time it can mean that the person has thrown off the burdens (perhaps because they have become too much to bear). From here the situation branches again. Does he or she throw down the sticks because of a realization that he or she can use the energy to better purpose? Or does the person only rebel against the responsibilities without really doing anything constructive? A woman I once read for described it as a question of throwing the sticks behind or before us. If behind, we attempt a new direction. If before, it means we will pick them up again and continue trudging on the same road.",

However, he has not yet reached his destination. (A fiction, of course; he could just as easily be coming home. I am following Waite’s lead on this.) He is assuming victory. Optimism produces the very success it desires and expects. Often, though certainly not always, it requires only a true belief in ourselves to find the energy to accomplish what we want.

The card represents a domestic environment filled with Fire optimism, eagerness, and celebration. As in the Six we see people following the dancers. Unlike that card, however, where the soldiers followed the charismatic leader, the people here are swept along by joy. They are leaving a walled city for the open bower.

The young competitors of Five have achieved success, especially in business, career, etc., though the card implies emotional maturity as well. The Wands eagerness does not vanish, but here he sends his ships out to explore new areas while he himself stays behind. In contrast to the Knight the image suggests keeping a solid basis in what we have already accomplished while we continue to open new areas and interests in ourselves. Sometimes in readings this can mean maintaining a primary commitment to existing relationships while still looking for new friends or lovers. Some Tarot cards acquire special meanings that apply only to specific situations. For a person troubled or struggling with the past the Three of Wands can indicate becoming at peace with his or her memories. They become like boats sailing past on a wide river and then out to sea. The setting sun, a symbol of contentment, lights up the river, symbol of a person's emotional life, with a warm golden light. In the Three of Wands we see the first of the Gate cards (the SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM suit of Wands, with its emphasis on action, contains fewer of these inner cards than any of the other suits). Metaphysically the sea has always evoked in people a sense of the vast ness and mystery of the universe, while rivers symbolize the experience of the ego dissolving into that great Sea. The boats represent that part of us which explores deep experience, while the man expresses the importance of rooting ourselves in ordinary reality before we attempt such metaphysical journeys. This schematic explanation gives only an intellectual shadow of the card’s true meanings. 'That meaning lies in the experience of merging with the picture until the boats carry us into the unknown areas of the self. Significantly it is the addition of Water and Earth in the form of the sea and the rock which direct the images to Fire's greatest potential.

Waite compares his weariness to that of Alexander, who supposedly wept after he had conquered the known world because he then could think of nothing else to do with his life (his death shortly afterwards no doubt gave this legend an extra boost). W'aite's comment suggests that the Wands love of battle and challenge can leave one with no real satisfaction in actual accomplishments when the fight has been won.

We cannot cause or produce them by any normal means; they come to us as hands emerging from clouds. Only by reaching the high states of awareness shown in the later cards of the Major Arcana can we understand the sources of these bursts of elemental energy. In ordinary situations it is enough to experience and appreciate them. At the beginning of some situation, no card could signal a better start. It gives eagerness and strength.

This can happen on a practical level, through too much activity, too many new starts without consolidating past gains; or emotionally, through being overconfident of friendship, or simply overbearing; or finally, sexually, through refusing to contain that fiery sexual appetite.

And like the Fire King, his position as ‘maintainer of society' does not fit him all that comfortably. Cups symbolize the creative imagination, and to achieve success he has had to discipline and even suppress his dreams. The fish, symbol of creativity, hangs around his neck, but as an artificial ornament, fie has directed his creative powers into socially responsible achievements. Waite describes him as a man of ‘business, law, divinity’. In a sense he has matured his suit; but Water demands to flow, not to be confined. Behind his throne a live fish jumps through the waves, signifying that creative imagination remains alive even when pushed to the background. Similarly, his throne floats on the lively sea, yet he himself does not touch the water (compare the Queen, p.52), indicating that his achievement derives ultimately from creativity, though he has shaped his life in such a way as to separate him from his own playful poet-like imagination. In its extreme the imagery suggests someone who has dammed up his or her emotions and imagination. It also shows, more gently, a person who expresses these qualities, but not as central to her or his life. Responsibility comes before self-expression. CUPS The King does not look at his cup; rather he holds it in the same way he holds his sceptre, symbol of power. Some commentators see the King as a person of troubled emotions, even anger and violence, who habitually suppresses these feelings even from himself, always maintaining a calm exterior. This interpretation derives from the idea that Kings stand for Air and therefore the King of Cups is Air of Water, the troubled emotions of Air covered by the benign influence of Water. In some contexts, especially the arts, the King takes on a very different meaning. Because he is the leader of his suit, he can symbolize success, achievement, mastery, and maturity in artistic work.",

The card upside down can mean that the violent Air emotions emerge from their calm exterior, perhaps through the pressure of outside events. Romantically, the King of Cups reversed can suggest a dishonest yet domineering lover, more often male, sometimes female. Finally, in relation to the arts, the King reversed can suggest that an artist’s achievement has proved to be insignificant, or that a person has not yet matured and cannot point to a significant body of work.

    "description": "The most successful and balanced of the Cups, in some ways of all the Minor cards, the Queen is almost a mundane version of the World Dancer. Coming between the outer responsibility of the King and the passiveness of the Knight, she shows the possibility of blending imagination and action, creativity and social usefulness. Her throne, decorated with cherubic mermaids, sits on land, indicating her vital connection to the outer world and to other people, a connection more real than the King’s. At the same time the water Mows over her feet and merges with her dress, signifying the unity of self with emotion and imagination. The water suggests also unconscious forces - the underlying spiritual patterns shown in the Major Arcana - nourishing conscious life. The unity of water, land, and the Queen implies that we do not feed the imagination by giving it complete freedom to wander where it will, but rather by directing it into valuable activity, an idea that most artists would endorse. This idea appears even more strongly in the Nine of Pentacles, emblem of creative discipline. Waite describes the cup she holds as her own creation. It is the most elaborate of the Cups (whatever we may think about its style!) and symbolizes the achievement brought about through using the imagination. Notice its church-like shape. Until the modern age (and still in more archaic cultures) all CUPS art expressed and glorified spiritual experience. 1'he Queen stares at the cup intently, showing the strong will that directs and moulds creative force without suppressing it. At the same time her look suggests that the creative person derives inspira¬ tion for future activity from her or his past achievements. Compare her fierce gaze with the dreaminess of the Knight, or the cloudy fantasies of the Seven. Will power alone will not unite imagination and action. Only love can give meaning to her actions, and realize her goals. These goals are not simply creative in the narrow sense of art, but in the wider sense of making something whole and alive out of the opportunities and elements given by life. They can include emotional goals, especially family, for while the King symbolizes society, the Queen symbolizes the family, for men as well as women. What is most important is that she joins consciousness to feeling. She knows what she wants and will take the steps necessary to get it. Yet she acts always with an awareness of love. Waite says ‘loving intelligence and hence the gift of vision’, terms suggesting that a vision of life as joyful can only come as a gift, but love can open us to receiving such a gift, to recogniz¬ ing that it exists. With intelligence joined to love we return the gift by taking that vision and making something real and lasting from it.",

Therefore dreams dominate this card, with its images of a slow horse, and a knight lost in the enticements of his cup, symbol of the imagination. At the same time the creative force is less powerful here than in any of the other Cups court cards. Only a narrow river flows through a parched land. The Knight has not learned that the true imagination feeds on action rather than fantasy. By this I mean that if we do nothing with our dreams they remain vague and unrelated to the rest of our lives. VVe may make another point about the Knight's dreami¬ ness. What feeds it - inner principles, as in myth or archetypal art; or self-indulgence, as in daydreams and escapist films or books? The English poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, distinguished between 'imagination' and ‘fancy'. Both take the mind away from ordinary experience and perceptions. However, while the first derives from and leads to an awareness of underlying spiritual truth, the second produces only fantasies that may excite, but ultimately lack real meaning. They derive from the ego rather than the uncon¬ scious. Nothing emerges from his cup (compare the Page; p.56). CUPS Nor has he shaped it into something greater than it was, as has the Queen. A Knight is a figure committed to action and involvement. Water, on the other hand, symbolizes passive¬ ness. The symbolism - Fire of Water in the Golden Dawn system - indicates the elements as unreconciled. By denying this basic commitment to the world, he does not allow his imagination to produce anything. Because he is a Knight the outside world of action, of sex, may pull him even while he pursues his thoughts and fan¬ tasies. His passiveness can sometimes be a pose, almost exaggerated for the purpose of denying those temptations and desires which disturb his peace. Romantically the Knight can represent a lover who does not wish to commit him or herself, who is perhaps attractive yet passive, withdrawn, or narcissistic. These harsh images of the Knight all deal with his conflicts. At the same time his helmet and feet are winged, his horse is spirited in its slowness. And he resembles Death, symbol of transformation. If the Knight is not pulled by responsibility or desire, if he follows a genuine vision rather than escape from outside commitments, then he can go very deeply into himself, turning the Knight energy into an exploration of his own inner world.",

    "description": "The pleasant nature of Cups tends to lull us away from what we have to do. The Eight begins (or ends) a series of five cards dealing with the Water problem of action. In this card we see someone turning his back on a double row of standing Cups which symbolize a situation that not only has provided happiness, but actually continues to do so. In contrast to the SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM Five, all the Cups remain upright; nothing has been knocked over. And yet the person knows that the time has come to leave. The imagery suggests one of the true uses of Water instinct - an ability to sense when something has ended before it either dries up or comes crashing down around us, to know the time to move on. We see the figure climbing a hill, going to higher ground, with the implication of moving from a less to a more meaningful situation. Notice the resemblance of the figure to the Hermit beside him. To reach the height of the Hermit's wisdom, we must first put the ordinary things of life behind us. The Hermit reminds us that the image of land does not necessarily mean action or involvement in the ordinary sense, but can suggest almost the opposite: that is, withdrawing from outer activity to seek a greater self-awareness. At first the scene appears to take place at night; but when we look closer we see that actually it depicts an eclipse, with the moon moving across the sun. A moon phase, that is, a period of inner awareness, has taken over from outer-directed activity. By joining moon imagery to a scene of movement, the card teaches us that developing a deeper sense of self is also an action. Remember that the Hermit, by reversing the sexual polarity of the High Priestess above him, combines action and intuition in a definite programme of self-knowledge. Whether we view the figure as moving away from the world, or into action, the card symbolizes leaving a stable situation. In its deepest level this card acts as a Gate, similar in certain ways to the Three of Wands. Both work through the image of a journey into the unknown, but while the Fire card is drawn to Water, the Water card is drawn to Air. The Three of Wands breaks down the ego and frees the exploring spirit, while the Eight of Cups moves from the vagueness of Water to the specific knowledge of abstract principles symbolized by the climb up the Hermit’s mountain.",

Such a description characterizes many relationships. CUPS Usually, however, the card reversed maintains its quality of awareness and correct response. It symbolizes that the time to leave has not come, that the situation will continue to give joy and meaning. One final possibility: timidity, leaving a situation because a person lacks the courage to pursue it and take everything she or he can get from it. Many people make this a pattern in their lives; they become involved in relationships, work, projects, etc., and then run away, either when difficulties arise, or when the time comes for genuine commitment.",

The emblem of this second attitude is childhood, pictured as a safe time, when parents, or older brothers and sisters, protected us and gave us everything we needed. Sometimes such an attitude can produce a warm secure feeling which will help people face their current problems. In this sense the card shows the past (the dwarf) giving a gift of memories to the future, symbolized by the child. At other times, however, a fixation on the past can prevent a person from facing current problems. The past can distract from the present just as much as fantasies of the future. There are other meanings for the Six beside memory. The CUPS Sixes show relationships of giving and receiving. Here we see the image of a teacher or protector giving wisdom and security to someone who might be a family member, a student, or a friend.",

The picture depicts sorrow but also acceptance. Three cups lie spilled out, but two remain standing, even if at the moment the figure concentrates on the three. The woman (or man; the androgynous character of the figure indicates that sorrow unites the sexes) stands rigid, wrapped in black, the colour of grief. She needs to accept that some happiness has suddenly vanished, been knocked over. She does not yet realize that something remains, for first she must understand and accept the loss. Has she herself knocked over the cups, either through recklessness or by taking them for granted? In the sense of awareness the card relates to Justice, emblem of truth and the acceptance of responsibility. In her pose and costume she resembles the Hermit, who cloaks himself in wisdom to hold him upright in his task of looking within for a vision of his life, the vision he will accept injustice. The river represents the flow of sorrow but the bridge symbolizes consciousness and determination. It leads from the past (loss) to the future (new beginnings). When she has accepted her loss she can then turn, pick up the two remaining cups, and cross over the bridge to the house, symbol of stability and continuity. With its deep evocation of regret the card forms another Gate, bringing to us that sense of spiritual loss and separation which all over the world has given rise to myths of a fall or an exile from Paradise.",

    "reversed_meaning": "The basic meaning of the card can change in three ways when reversed. First, it can mean not accepting the loss, and as an extension of this, false projects or mistakes. Second, it can indicate support from others, friendship, new interests and occupations after some sad or disturbing event. Finally, it can emphasize an awareness of what remains important and permanent in the face of sorrow. In this sense the woman turns from the three to the two. Here the two cups symbolize the solid basis of a person’s life; they remain standing because they are not so easily knocked over.

In study, and most commonly in practice, however, it indicates the pledging of friendship, the beginning of a love affair. In the Two of Cups we see the winged lion over the caduceus of Hermes, symbol of healing and wisdom. In both cases, the card shows how two people by uniting their separate qualities and abilities through love, produce something in their lives beyond what either would have achieved alone. The lion symbolizes sexuality, the wings Spirit. Love gives a greater meaning to the sexual drive that leads us to it. While the man symbolizes action and movement, the woman symbolizes emotion, sensitivity, and an appreciation of experience. By uniting these two qualities we give our lives value.",

Now, other cards indicated she had reached a level of technical mastery in what she had been doing, while the Fool, as an outcome, showed her taking a leap into a new area. But the Two of Cups showed she would find success if she linked her technical ability and explorations to the spiritual grounding symbolized by the woman.",
    "reversed_meaning": "In different ways the reversed card shows a breakdown of the ideals symbolized right side up. It can mean a love affair or friendship which has gone sour in some way, in particular because of jealousy and a breakdown of trust. It can mean simply the end of a relationship. Depending on the cards around it, it can signify a relationship endangered by internal or external pressures. Another possibility is infatuation, when people pretend to others, to themselves, that a love affair means more than it actually does. In a similar vein the reversed card can show people going through the motions of a love affair, with one or both of them not really caring.

The Ace of Cups has the immediate meaning of a time of happiness and love, a gift of joy. J ust as fire makes the world, so love gives it value. The Smith picture, with its dove and wafer, specifically shows the Holy Grail, said to contain the physical presence of the Holy Ghost at work in the world. In the more subtle versions of the King Arthur legend, it was not really chivalry — that is, a moral structure - that held together King Arthur's glorious kingdom, but rather the secret presence of the Holy Grail hidden in the land. When the Grail left (because Arthur’s knights failed to approach it in a spiritual way) the kingdom fell apart. The allegory tells us that the world does not function primarily by its laws, its moral order and its social structures, but rather by the spiritual basis which gives all these things meaning, and protects them from corruption. When we look at existence as something solely to be conquered (the way Arthur’s knights went after the Grail) we bring only chaos. Cups - Water - symbolize receptivity.

    "description": "As a maintainer of the social structure the King represents authority, power, and judgement. He takes the mental energy of Air and uses it to uphold and rule the world with the keenness of his mind and the force of his personality. His crown is yellow, the colour of mental energy, while his mantle is purple, for wisdom. His cap, a burnouse-like head-dress, is red, the colour of action. The King's intellect does not exist for itself alone, but rather for what it can do, as a tool of authority. Similarly, his sword, unlike that of the Queen of Swords or of Justice, does not point straight up, for pure wisdom, but rather tilts slightly to the right, the side of action. The requirement to act upon his judgements tends to distort the power of judgement itself, a fact we can see if we compare the situation of an academic observer of politics with that of someone running a country. Moreover, the emphasis on social-minded ‘realism’ may narrow his viewpoint to a very limited materialism. We can see him in the man or woman priding him or herself on tough-minded common sense, with no time for ‘mystic mumbo jumbo’. Such people usually ignore how much of their thinking depends on preconception and prejudice, rather than observation of life. Notice the resemblance to the Emperor. We can call the King the Emperor’s representative in the real world. While the trump embodies the archetype of order, law, society, the King of Swords maintains these principles in practice. Two birds, the animal emblem of the Swords court cards, fly behind the throne. The bird symbolizes the mind’s ability to take us into the high air of wisdom, removed from fiery passion, watery emotion, or earthly material corruption. The number two, on the other hand, symbolizes choice, the constant tension between abstract thought and the action that must be taken in the world. But if the birds symbolize the mind’s ability to climb above the world they also symbolize the remoteness such an attitude can produce. Notice, that the King’s throne is seemingly in the clouds. Like the King of Wands, the Swords King can tend towards arrogance, his powerful mind and will setting him above the more confused people around him. In social terms the imagery suggests the tendency of government and rulers to divorce their judgements from the real needs of people. In more personal terms, we see the remote King in men or women who are harsh, cold, judgemental. As a husband or lover, the King of Swords often indicates a domineering or controlling person. In his best sense the King of Swords evokes Justice, the card directly beneath the Emperor in the Major Arcana. When he connects with this trump, the King stands for social justice, wise laws, and above all, a commitment to intellectual honesty, and the need to put knowledge into practice. Like Justice, and alone of all the court cards, he stares directly out at us, a master of wisdom compelling us to recognize and hold to the truth.",

In connection with the Queen or the Knight it may mean a difficult relationship or a failure to mature (see the section on Readings for relationships between court cards of the same suit).

Though clouds gather around her, her head remains above them in the clear air of truth. One bird, a symbol of the purity of her wisdom, flies high above her.

A mild personality, taken just a little too far, becomes weak and depressed, especially if his placidity has covered a repressed desire for either adventure or greater advancement. The Knight of Pentacles reversed can sometimes indicate a crisis. If a person has dedicated her or his life to a job or some similar outer responsibility, and that meaning is taken away - say through dismissal or retirement — then discouragement and depression can overcome him or her. Another example would be a woman who has dedicated her life to her children and now finds that they have grown up and away from her. Though such extreme meanings of course occur rarely in actual readings, they remain implied in the Knight's basic paradox: deeply grounded in, yet unaware of, the magic beneath him, he identifies himself with his functions.

If the situation is one that calls for such an easygoing approach then the Page’s unattached attitude is very bene¬ ficial. But if a more difficult problem is involved, then the Page's practice becomes hard to maintain. It requires ‘vigilance’ to use Waite’s term, making sure that people or situations do not get too close. Much of the Page’s energy goes to looking over his shoulder. As a somewhat aged student, Hamlet embodied the Page's attitude of observation and irony. His situation, however, called for the aggressive approach of the Knight.

The key term is ‘reasonable fear’, which can refer to, say, political oppression - as of racial or sexual minorities; or social oppression - a feeling of being a scapegoat because of appearance, speech, etc.; or simply the personal oppression of a domineering family or partner. The important thing is that the problem is real, but because we cannot directly attack it, we tend to hide in ourselves, keeping in our anger and resentment. Anger turned in on itself becomes depression and from there suspicion. The person who was laughed at as a child for her big nose thinks that everyone is looking at her. The black person believes that any complaint at work is a racial slur. And suspicion easily leads to self-doubt and shame. Often it does not even help, at least not completely, if we rationally know that we have no reason to feel ashamed, that in fact those who have ridiculed or oppressed us should feel the shame.

On a very different level the Eight of Swords acts as a Gate to a special awareness. By identifying with it we gain a sense of our own ignorant condition, something which many people will intellectually recognise (paradox of paradoxes) but not really accept.

Sometimes the card means simply a daring act, even a coup that takes the sting out of opposition. More often, it stands for an impulsive act when a careful plan is required. The picture shows us someone grinning as he makes off with his enemy’s weapons. He has not attacked the camp, he cannot even carry all the swords. The card implies schemes and actions that do not solve anything. Not as obvious, but sometimes more important, is the sense of isolation involved. He is acting alone, unable or unwilling to get anyone’s help.

    "description": "A strange and powerful image, this card more than any other illustrates how Pamela Smith’s images reach beyond Arthur Waite's formulas. The Pictorial Key says ‘journey by water, route, way, expedient'. But the picture of a ferryboat at SWORDS twilight, carrying shrouded figures to a wooded isle, suggests a more spiritual journey - in myth, Charon carrying the dead across the River Styx. A great silence fills this card, like the silence of Salvador Dali’s paintings. Usually this card does not signify death, though it can indicate mourning; nor does it show transformation, in the sense of Death in the Major Arcana. Rather it depicts a quiet passage through a difficult time. Waite says, ‘The freight is light’; and Eden Gray writes, ‘The swords do not weigh down the boat’. Though we carry our troubles with us we have adapted to them; they will not sink us or bear us down. On a simple level it means functioning in some difficult situation without attacking the problems. It can refer to an immedaite problem or a situation that has gone on for years. Looking deeper we see the image of a long sorrow - mourning is an example, but not the only one - which a person has felt for so long that it no longer gives pain, but has become part of life. There is another, less disturbing meaning - that of a quiet passage, physically (certainly the literal meaning of a journey must not be forgotten) or spiritually, a time of easy transition. Notice the ferryman’s black pole. Black indicates potentiality; where nothing final has happened, all things remain possible. By staying calm we waste neither energy nor opportunity. The Six of Swords is a Gate. Looking at it with sensitivity and then entering the picture will produce first a quieting effect on the mind and then later, slowly, a sense of movement within the self.",
    "upright_meaning": "",
    "reversed_meaning": "Seen in one way the balance and peace become disturbed; the passage is no longer serene for the water, symbol of emotion, becomes stirred up. So the reversed card can suggest a stormy journey, physically or spiritually. It can refer also to the idea that when we try to attack some longstanding problem, especially one accepted by everyone else, we agitate the situation. As one example, an unsatisfying or oppressive relationship can go quietly along for years until one of the members decides to do something about it. To try to remove the swords from the boat can sink it, for the swords, after all, are plugging up the holes. In another way, the Six reversed can show communication, reminding us that right side up the people maintain their composure by not speaking or looking at each other. If the swords symbolize unhappy memories and the silence is a defence then communication can be painful. It can also begin healing.",

And yet it mirrors a real situation that most people will experience at some time in their lives. All the Fives show conflict or loss. Swords carry this idea to the extreme of defeat. Sometimes the meaning of the card will focus on the large figure in the foreground - the victor. More commonly we identify with the two figures turned away. They have lost some battle, and now the whole world bears down on them - the water choppy, the sky jagged. A sense of humiliation as well as weakness goes with their defeat. The image of an enemy can refer to a real person, to an overall situation or to an inner feeling of inadequacy. Once I did a reading for two people who had suffered at the hands of a disturbed and vengeful boss, and who now wanted to know if they should bring him to court. They decided against it when the Five of Swords indicated they would lose. Later two other people did sue the man for the same kind of misconduct. They lost the case.",

It is a difficult state to overcome, though other influences, particularly those symbolized by Wands, may help. Swords are more pessimistic than any cards in the Major Arcana. Taken alone, no Minor suit can show the true balance of life. They break experience into parts and therefore distort and exaggerate.

    "description": "Fours relate to stabilization; for the unhappy Swords this translates as rest or even just retreat. The image shows not death but withdrawal. People sometimes respond to difficulties by isolating themselves, literally hiding in their houses, or simply flattening their emotional reactions to hide inside themselves. This card once appeared in a reading for a man accustomed to dealing forcefully with everyone around him. The card showed him that when his aggressiveness failed, or when his confident mask grew too heavy for him, he hid from the world rather than show his other side or try to work with other people. Withdrawal, however, can also lead to healing, if the purpose is not to hide but to recoup strength. The card can mean holding back from a fight until there is a better chance of winning. Similarly, by withdrawing for a time after some deep hurt a person gives him or herself a chance to recover. Notice that the knight lies in a church, and that the window shows Christ giving a healing blessing to a supplicant. The imagery suggests the Fisher King of the Grail legend, whose physical wound mirrored the spiritual sickness of the kingdom. The picture also recalls Sleeping Beauty. Both these figures needed outsiders to awaken them. The King lay ill until Galahad brought the Grail’s blessing; and the princess, symbol of a neurotic fear of life, remained asleep until the prince, refusing to be stopped by the fence of thorns (the neurotic will use the force of her or his personality to set up barriers against other people), roused her through sexual life-energy (in the Disney version he kisses her; in folk tales he has intercourse with her). Withdrawal, even for the purpose of recovery, can shut a person off from the world, creating a kind of spell only outside energy can break.",

Yet, for all its gloom, the picture brings a certain calm in the symmetry of its swords. To true sorrow we can make only one response - take the pain into our hearts, accept it and go beyond it. The Nine raised the question of how to continue after a great anguish. The Three tells us that we must not push the pain away from us, but somehow take it deep inside until it becomes transformed by courage and love. Once, in a reading for myself, after a death in my family, the Three of Swords came up crossed by the Three of Cups. At first I thought this meant setting joy and friendship against sorrow. Two cards of the same number, however, often mean a transformation. And the crossing card often emerges from the first in some way.

    "description": "One method of handling problems or opposition is to push everything away beyond an emotional fence. If we let nothing approach us, then nothing can hurt us. In contrast to the Eight, the blindfold here shows not confusion, but a deliberate closing of the eyes. The figure has tied it on herself so that she will not have to choose between friend and enemy, for such choice becomes the first step in once again involving herself with other people. The swords remain ready to strike anyone who tries to come close. They represent anger and fear creating a precarious balance; the one wants to strike out, the other wants to hide, and so the person remains tensed between them. Notice, however, the effect this posture has on the woman. First of all, the crossed arms close off her heart. The imagery of blocked emotions continues in the way the grey dress seems SWORDS to merge into the stone seat. At the same time the heavy swords raise the centre of gravity from the solar plexus to the chest. When a person holds in emotions the breathing becomes shallower, the body becomes rigid. Paradoxically, the attempt to stop emotion makes a person more emotional, as she or he thinks and acts not from the centre but from the constricted chest, seeing not the world, but her own image behind the blindfold. Compare the Two of Swords to the High Priestess, number 2, in the Major Arcana. They sit in similar postures, but where the Priestess appears relaxed, tension coats the Two of Swords. A veil separates the Priestess from the waters of the unconscious hidden behind her; no veil protects the blindfolded woman from her disturbed pool of emotions. And yet that shallow pool is not the same water as that behind the Priestess. The weight of the swords makes it easy for the woman to be tipped over into the choppy waters. Because it makes us concentrate on the emotions, a defensive attitude makes us more prone to outbursts, to anger and hysteria.",

    "description": "The final (first) Sword card returns us to the true essence of the suit - intellect. Pointing straight up for true perception, the sword pierces the crown of the material world. Wisdom leads us beyond illusions and limitations to the spiritual truth contained within life. Many of the Swords cards suffer from the illusion that life contains only sorrow and pain. The mountains symbolize ‘abstract truth’, objective facts of existence, independent of personal viewpoint and experience. The Major Arcana depicts this truth for us; more than any other Minor card the Ace of Swords reaches through to the fifth element. However, intellect alone, divorced from intui¬ tion, will only lead to more illusion. We need the Ace of Cups, that is, love, to find the truth; yet only intellect can take us beyond immediate experience. Many people maintain that only our emotions express the real us, that emotional reactions alone will lead us to the truth. Often, however, emotions are exaggerated, egotistic, or self-indulgent. But neither will intellect alone bring real awareness. Both truth and awareness must come from a deeper level of spiritual values and experience. And so the hands come from clouds, leading us back to Spirit. The symbolism of truth holds for mundane experiences as well. In confusing, emotional, or oppressive situations, the SWORDS mind can pierce the fog and knots to give a clear understan¬ ding of the real facts. Truth expresses the Ace in its most valuable form. On another level the card signifies simply emotional force, both love and hate, in extreme forms. Notice the tight grip. The emotions, too, are a gift, enabling us to experience life intensely, but they always remain hard to hold and harder still to direct.",

The casual way he sits on his throne, the fond way he looks at his pentacle - here the symbol of his capabilities and his achievements - show him satisfied with life. He is generous, even courageous, though not especially given to adventure. The role of King does not frustrate him as it does the Kings of Wands and Cups. Perhaps at an earlier stage of his life and career he might have suffered from impatience or doubt. Now his success has justified his life, allowing him to relax and enjoy it. Enjoying life means a closeness to nature as well. Though his castle - symbol of his dominant place in society - rises in the background, he sits in his garden, with flowers on his crown, and with grapes - symbol of life's sweetness - decorating his robe. The very leaves and flowers seem to merge with his robe, just as the water flowed into the Queen of Cups’ dress. Life is good to him and he means to enjoy it. A Tarot reading once produced the Fool crossed by the King of Pentacles (the two cards greatly resemble each other in their colour schemes). The conjunction forms a fine example of what 1 call vertical and horizontal time, that is, the inner and outer worlds. The King symbolizes ordinary PENTACLES activity, accomplishments, social position, success, while the Fool stands for the inner spiritual freedom that allows a person to enjoy these things and build upon them without getting trapped in a narrow materialist view. Consider two people with the same outer worlds - both successful, respected, wealthy; yet inwardly one may be tense, or frustrated, or afraid, while the other remains joyful and at peace. If we see the Fool as the beginning of the Major Arcana, the King of Pentacles as the final card of the Minor, then the two stand at opposite ends of the Tarot. But this polarity holds true only if we see the cards in a line. If we envision them in a circle, then the Fool and the King of Pentacles become joined together.",
    "upright_meaning": "",
    "reversed_meaning": "The King is meant for success. Reversing him suggests failure or simply mediocrity. The lack of fulfilment brings dissatisfaction, feelings of weakness, and doubt. Taken another way we can see the upside down King as symbolizing the idea of success corrupted, the image of a man or a woman who will use any means to achieve his or her goals. If we describe the King of Pentacles as someone who needs a vital connection with nature (and not everyone does, despite contemporary assumptions), the King reversed stands for the state of being cut off from that rejuvenating Row.

The rabbit in the lower right-hand corner stands not only for sexual fertility, but also for the spiritual fruitfulness of a life that has found its own rhythm in the world around it. Her qualities, as well as the sexual symbolism, relate her to the patron of Pentacles, the Empress.

This separation means more than being isolated from plants and animals. Rather it means a loss of daily rhythm in life, a dissatisfaction with the whole environment, and an inability to appreciate what the environment has to offer. In a reading the Queen reversed not only points out these qualities in the subject, but suggests a dual remedy. First, a build up in confidence; besides emphasizing his or her accomplishments and good qualities a person can do this through meditation with the Queen right side up. Second, a grounding of the emotions in natural things, ordinary pleasures, satisfying work.",

His steadiness slows down to the point of inertia, his plodding responsibility gives way to idleness. A mild personality, taken just a little too far, becomes weak and depressed, especially if his placidity has covered a repressed desire for either adventure or greater advancement. The Knight of Pentacles reversed can sometimes indicate a crisis. If a person has dedicated her or his life to a job or some similar outer responsibility, and that meaning is taken away - say through dismissal or retirement — then discouragement and depression can overcome him or her. Another example would be a woman who has dedicated her life to her children and now finds that they have grown up and away from her. Though such extreme meanings of course occur rarely in actual readings, they remain implied in the Knight's basic paradox: deeply grounded in, yet unaware of, the magic beneath him, he identifies himself with his functions.

    "description": "One of the most symbolic and deeply-layered Minor cards, the Ten shows us the very image of the Gate opening to hidden experience in ordinary things. Like the Ten of Cups it deals with domestic life, but where the men and women in Cups celebrate the gift, the family here does not notice the magic all around them. On the surface the card represents the established home, the good life, a secure and comfortable position in the world. The people concerned, however, appear to take the comfort for granted; they find the security boring or stifling. In contrast to the Ten of Cups (the two cards will often appear together in readings) the family here does not seem to communicate with each other. The man and woman face opposite ways, though the woman glances anxiously over her shoulder at the man. The child hangs on nervously to its mother, but looks away. And none of them notices the old man outside the arch. Though the card expresses mundaneness, magic signs cover it. The ten pentacles form the Qabalistic Tree of Life, something which appears nowhere else in the deck. Notice also the magic wand resting against the arch; no other Minor card contains one. The arch itself bears a relief of balanced scales (just above the old man’s head). Now, scales stand for Justice, and further, for subtle forces which keep the everyday world PENTACLES from breaking into chaos. By ‘subtle forces’ I do not mean only so-called ‘occult’ laws, such as polarity, or the law of correspondences (as above, so below). The term applies also to nature’s generally more accepted workings, such as gravity, or electro-magnetism. Because we learn about these in school we should not consider such phenomena as any the less marvellous. The fact is, we all take the universe for granted simply because it works so well. Even more than the other images, the old man evokes magic. He resembles the image, from every culture, of the god or angel who comes disguised as a beggar or traveller to visit some family, test their virtues of hospitality and generosity, and then leave them a magical gift. In the case of Abraham and Sarah the angels gave them a son, Isaac. In many such stories only the dogs recognize the visitor (just as in other tales the dogs alone run from the Devil when he comes in disguise). Because they have not buried their instincts in blase human rationalism, the dogs can sense the wonderful when it comes to call. Now, most of these tales emphasize the moral ‘Be nice to everyone. You never know whom you might turn away'. But we can give the story a more subtle interpretation. By acting a certain way, people create in themselves the ability to recognize and receive the blessings in the world around them. All these hidden signs and wonders point up the basic theme of Pentacles: the everyday world contains a magic greater than any of us can usually see. The magic is all around us, in nature, in the very fact that life exists and that this vast universe does not fly apart. Inside the arch we see a bright ordinary day; outside darker tones prevail, even in the old man’s coat of many colours, with its signs of astrology and ritual magic. The family stand under the arch posed as in a play. For ail its firm reality, the everyday world, the comfortable lives we take for granted, and even the troubles and miseries that often occupy our minds, are only a play, in which we all follow the parts set out for us by our upbringing and by society (the recognition that we are a product of our conditioning is the first step to freeing our¬ selves from it). The true reality remains ancient, dark, and mysterious. Though we look through the arch the perspective of the card places us outside it, with the demon visitor. By merging with SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM this card we can find ourselves beyond the Gate, looking in at the little dramas of our own daily lives. By going further with it we can experience that wild vibrant universe existing in the very centre of the ordinary. When the hero Odysseus arrived home from his wanderings in the wild, monster-ridden world outside civilized Greece, he came disguised as a beggar. Only his dog recognized him. ['hough he wore rags, they were glorious rags (much like the visitor’s patchwork coat) for the goddess Athena had given them to him. Odysseus returned to the domestic world from the wild; he destroyed the evil in his house and re-established the moral order. Yet first he had to experience what lay beyond. The Ten of Pentacles takes us there as well.",

    "reversed_meaning": "If the sense of boredom with life increases it can lead to taking risks, especially financial or emotional ones. Sometimes, depending on the contexts or the projected results, the risks are justified; for instance, the Fool beside the Ten of Pentacles would urge the gamble. At other times the risks come less from need than from impatience with what we already have. This situation becomes more pointed when the Ten of Pent- acles appears with the Ten of Cups. The parallel with Odysseus stands out when the card becomes reversed. Most of that hero’s troubles arose because of a streak of recklessness that made him do wild things at just the wrong moment. The urge to gamble stood in opposition to his basic qualities of caution, skill, and foresight. And yet the wildness maintained the balance. Without it Odysseus would not have seen the world beyond the home and family to which he finally returned.",

    "description": "As material cards Pentacles deal with success and what it means in a person’s life. Unlike the figure in Ten the woman here is sharply aware of the good things in her life. Her hand rests on the Pentacles, her thumb hooks on a grapevine. Awareness is one of the card’s basic meanings, especially self-awareness and the ability to distinguish what matters in life, what goals truly demand our best efforts. The card signifies success - but not simply the material benefits; it means as well the sense of certainty that comes with knowing one has made the right choices and followed them with the necessary actions. The pentacles growing on the bushes symbolize a life that is productive and alive. ‘Success’ here means not so much worldly achievement as success in ‘creating’ ourselves out of the material given us by the circumstances and conditions of our life. And ‘certainty', in its strongest sense, means more than looking back and seeing that we have done the right thing. It also means the ability to know where others can only guess. The Nine of Pentacles stands as the emblem of this quality, the true mark of the evolved person (for a further discussion see the end of the section on Readings); study and meditation with this card will therefore help achieve such certainty. We have seen that the Nines show' compromises and choices. This theme emerges in Pentacles as well. The woman stands alone in her garden. To achieve what she has, she has had to give up normal companionship. In readings, this symbolism does not mean that the card inevitably advises giving up a relationship; but it does call for self-reliance and a certain loneliness in pursuit of goals. The image in Fig. 48(b), slightly different from the official Rider version (Fig. 48(a)), comes from an American edition of several years ago. In this Nine of Pentacles a shadow darkens the woman’s face, as well as the grapes on the card’s right-hand side. Clearly she is turning away from the sun. The symbolism suggests a sacrifice. To make of her life what she wants she has had to give up not only companionship, but also such things as spontaneity, wandering, and recklessness. If the sacrifice seems too great, it perhaps means that we do not value enough the rewards of self-development. The image of the bird carries these ideas further. A soaring hunter, the falcon symbolizes the intellect, the imagination, the spirit. The hood, however, subdues it to its mistress, that is, the conscious will. Therefore, while at first glance the card means success, a more intimate knowledge of it shifts the primary meaning to that of discipline.",

    "description": "The way to Spirit for Pentacles lies not so much in success, or even awareness of value in ordinary things, as in the work that allows us to appreciate those things. The Nine shows discipline; the Eight shows the training that brings both discipline and skill. Work, whether physical, artistic, or spiritual (the Sufi Idries Shah speaks of ‘work' as the most basic of Sufi doctrines), cannot succeed if the person thinks only of the end result. Many artists and writers have testified to this fact, warning hopefuls that if they just want to become famous or rich they will never succeed. We have to care about the work itself. Therefore we see the apprentice lost in his task. And yet work also needs to be related to the outside world. However much we follow our standards and instincts or seek our own development the work we do lacks meaning if it does not serve the community. Therefore, behind his shop - though far away - stands a city, with a yellow road (yellow for mental action) leading to and from the workshop.",

Meaningful work gives more than material benefit; the person too grows. The Seven shows that moment of being able to look back with satisfaction on something accomplished. The ‘something’ may be as broad as a career or as simple as an immediate project. The card implies that whatever has been built up (including relationships between people) has reached a point where it can grow by itself, and the person can step back from it without it collapsing.",

    "description": "On the surface the Six of Pentacles illustrates the idea of sharing, generosity, charity. Notice, however, that the people form a hierarchy, one above two others. The card therefore signifies a relationship in which one person dominates others. He or she gives, but always from a basis of superiority. The scales are balanced; such relationships are often very stable, precisely because the people are well matched. Just as one wishes to dominate, the other(s) wishes to be dominated. The lower position does not really imply weakness; the dominated person often instigates the relationship, and in fact will subtly insist on maintaining it when the one who plays the dominant role might wish to change. Sometimes the hierarchy does not indicate a person but rather a situation - emotional, economic, or other - which dominates a person or a group of people. It may give them very little, but just enough to keep them from looking for something else. This can happen in a job which gives material benefit but little satisfaction or chance for improvement; or a relationship in which the people are unhappy but comfortable; or a political situation where people recognize they are oppressed, but do not wish to endanger what little security they have. The card bears a (distorted) relationship to all those Major cards (the Hierophant, the Lovers, the Devil, and others) in which some force holds together or reconciles the opposites of life. Here nothing becomes truly reconciled, but the situation maintains the balance and keeps it going. So far the meanings emphasize the two beggars. But what of the giver? He shows generosity, yet the balanced scales indicate he does not give spontaneously, but rather measures out what he thinks he can afford. In other words he gives what he will not miss. Emotionally this symbolizes a person who relates really easily to others yet always holds back his or her deepest feelings. As we said above, the relationship comes from both sides. Many people will only accept limited ‘gifts' from others. A display of strong emotions, for instance, may embarrass or scare them. The same may hold true for people who resent ‘charity’ and put any offer of help in that category. Therefore the Six of Pentacles may indicate giving people what they are able to receive. I have emphasized these words because they imply something beyond their literal meaning. Most people will unconsciously measure out their giving according to what other people expect from them; they avoid making themselves or other people uncomfortable. On the other hand, in order consciously to give people what they need and can use (rather than what they may think they want) one must have achieved a great degree of self-knowledge as well as awareness of human psychology in general. Few people really reach this level of giving; many people who think they perceive what someone else needs are actually projecting their own requirements and fears onto that person. As a more objective source of information the Tarot can help us understand our own or someone else’s needs. Because of these meanings, the Six of Pentacles relates to the Nine in the context of that card as an emblem of certitude. The idea of giving what people are able to receive carries a religious meaning as well. Mystics and esotericists often say that the truth hidden within a specific religion may run almost opposite to what that religion appears to say on the surface. For instance, while doctrine may teach us to control our desires through pious thoughts, the occultist may attempt to bring forth and work with her or his most hidden urges. This split exists because most people are not only incapable of but even unwilling to deal with religious/psychological teachings in their undisguised form. Even many who try may find the truth impossible to assimilate. Consider Rabbi Ben Abuysh, who lost his faith when he thought he saw two Gods. Idries Shah tells the fable of two men who come upon a tribe which harbours a great fear of water-melons, believing them to be demons. The first traveller tries to tell them the truth and is stoned as a heretic. The second accepts their orthodoxy, gains their confidence, and slowly works to educate them. Like this tale, the Six of Pentacles indicates the manner in which religion, and also esoteric teachings, give what we are capable of receiving. Waite, in describing this card, says ‘a person in the guise of a merchant’ - not a merchant, but a person ‘in the guise’ of one. And Nietzsche, in Thus Spake Zarathustra, has a hermit tell Zarathustra, ‘If you want to go to them, give no more than an aim, and let them beg for that. Give more and no one will listen. Yet who is this person in his merchant ‘guise? Is he simply a teacher, or a religious or psychological doctrine? The scales suggest something more - Justice, which stands for truth, not just as ‘correct information’ but as a living force holding together and balancing the universe. In the Ten of Pentacles we saw this force as the old man at the gate; here we see it as the merchant. Life gives us what we need, what we can use. Especially when we put ourselves in a position to receive. People who work with meditation or the Tarot or similar disciplines (as well as people doing artistic work) often notice a curious phenomenon. Life appears to conspire to give them what they need to help them on their way. Not a great burst, but just enough to give them a little push when they can most use it. Here is an example. At the time when I was working with these meanings for the Six of Pentacles I did a Tarot reading for myself in which the Six came up crossing the Knight of Cups. I took this to mean that by keeping a meditative frame of mind I would receive benefit. Now, this occurred some months after my mother's death, and while visiting my father I found and began to wear a mezuzah (a kind of Jewish amulet) of my mother’s. The mezuzah was inscribed with the name ‘Shaddai’. I recognized this word as a name of God, but did not know what it meant. Two or three days after the reading I went with my father to a synagogue for the Saturday prayers (something I would not have done on my own). On the way in I saw the name Shaddai on some jewellery on display, and mentioned my curiosity about its meaning. When I looked at the Bible reading for that day I discovered a note explaining the meaning of Shaddai. Translated as ‘Almighty’ it comes from a Hebrew root meaning ‘to overpower’. But it relates also to an Arabic word meaning ‘benevolence, giving of gifts’. Not only did the book answer my immediate question, but it gave me a greater understanding of the Six of Pentacles. The ‘merchant’ symbolizes the force of life, which not only gives us what we need and can receive, but can also overpower us (yet ordinarily does not if we do not wish it) with spiritual wonder. And I had gained these insights (which, because I experienced them, meant more to me than they would have as intellectual ideas) by literally putting myself in a position to receive, that is, by going with my father to the synagogue. From the Six of Pentacles we learn that the value of studying the Tarot or other disciplines lies not simply in the specific knowledge gained but also in the frame of mind created by the act of doing it. The work itself changes us. We can develop these changes consciously and deliberately through the mechanism of the Gate cards. By contemplating and joining their pictures we allow ourselves to receive their gifts.",
    "upright_meaning": "",
    "reversed_meaning": "The possible meanings relate to the meanings right side up. A lack of generosity, selfishness when sharing is expected. Sometimes this refers to a situation where the person is in a superior position. Then the giver is challenged to give more freely, not to measure out what he or she can afford, but really to share. At other times the card will point up the resentment of those people receiving charity, or its emotional counterpart, pity. Often the Six reversed indicates that some stable, but basically unequal or unsatisfying, situation has been disrupted. Whether or not this disruption results in a freer or more equal situation will depend on various factors, not least of which is the desire and courage of the people involved to continue a process which they, or some outside agency, have started. Finally, of course, it means not putting ourselves in a position to receive; either cutting ourselves off spiritually, or missing some practical opportunity, perhaps through arrogance or suspicion of other people's motives.",

    "description": "The various meanings for this card illustrate again that problem of certitude discussed in the section on Readings. How can we know for sure which meaning will apply in a real situation? At the same time the meanings show the way in which a situation can turn in very different directions. The Fives illustrate conflict and loss of some kind; in terms of Pentacles this means first of all material troubles, such as poverty or illness. Sometimes it implies a longstanding hardship. Observe that the people, though bent and crippled, are surviving. This card may indicate love, especially that of two people holding together in a bad situation. It may turn out that hardship has become one of the major factors keeping them together, so that relief from their material troubles may strain their unity - or they may think this will happen and therefore fear change. Notice that they are passing a church. Now, as a place of sanctuary, the church represents rest and relief from the storm. The people, however, do not see it. Human beings can get used to anything, and when they do they will often not see opportunities for change; they will even resist an end to their problems. If we compare these people with the kneeling beggars of Six we see that Five represents pride and independence, sometimes to a foolish degree when help is genuinely offered. As we examine the card more closely we can discover alternative, even opposed, meanings. The card shows no door to the church. As with many real churches today, which lock their doors like businesses at 5 pm, this church has perhaps shut the people out. The sanctuary has failed. We see first of all a comment on modern religion, which many feel has failed in the task of giving comfort and healing to people’s troubled souls. On a simpler level, in many countries the churches have grown rich at the people’s expense. Again, compare the Five with the Six. The merchant there may symbolize the modern secular church, giving what material assistance it can (or will), while the people’s spiritual needs go unattended. We can call the previous paragraph the ‘sociological’ interpretation of the doorless church. If we shift the emphasis to the people we can see a psychological view. Sometimes we may find ourselves in a situation where outside forces - social institutions, family, friends, etc. - cannot help us and we must struggle against the problems on our own. We can extend this idea to a ‘magic’ or occult interpretation. In Part One of this book I discussed how the magician, by setting out on a course of personal development, pits him or herself against the established Church, which traditionally acts as an intermediary between human beings and God. The choice may bring practical as well as political consequences. If the magician encounters dangerous psychic forces, then traditional religion cannot (let alone will not) help him or her overcome them. Compare the Five of Pentacles with the Hierophant, number 5 in the Major Arcana. There two supplicants submit to a doctrine that guides them in all situations. Here the people have rejected such doctrines, or have simply found them irrelevant.",
    "upright_meaning": "",
    "reversed_meaning": "Waite gives the meaning ‘chaos, disorder, ruin, confusion'. This suggests that the situation right side up has collapsed. The people are no longer surviving. While the immediate situation may seem much worse it can sometimes lead to improvement. When people accustom themselves to suffering, a collapse may release them. Whether they now can build something more positive depends partly on themselves and partly on the influence and opportunities around them.",

    "description": "We see first of all the image of a miser, and by extension, dependence on material comforts and security for the stability symbolized by the number Four. As if in response to the troubles shown on the previous card the man has given himself a protective layer against any economic (or other) problems that might arise in the future. However, while the Five showed two people, here we see one person, excluding others through his need for personal security. As magic signs the pentacles symbolize basic emotional/ psychic energy. The man here uses his pentacles to close himself off from the outside world. He has covered his most vital points: the crown of the head (literally a crown here), the heart and throat, and the soles of the feet. People working with SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF W1S1K)M chakra meditation will recognize the first two as vital points of connection to Spirit, and to other people. Covering the feet symbolizes blocking ourselves off from the world around us. The man cannot, however, seal his back. We always remain vulnerable to life, no matter how self-centred we fry to make ourselves. In certain situations, the Four, usually viewed as a ‘problem' card, becomes very appropriate. When life has broken down into chaos, then the Four indicates creating a structure, either through material things, or by turning emotional and mental energy inwards. The card remains an image of selfishness but sometimes selfishness may be precisely what is needed. People who meditate through their auras will usually, at the end of each meditation, follow a ritual of‘sealing' the aura at the chakra points. This practice prevents both a leaking of their own energy and a Hooding of the self by outside influences. Finally, on a very deep level, the Four of Pentacles symbolizes the way in which the human mind gives structure and meaning to the chaos of the material universe. This idea does not contradict the concept of forces balancing nature, as described in Ten and Six. Rather it adds to that idea, by showing that the mind not only perceives, but actually helps those forces to function. The fact that human beings exist in the universe as creators rather than as passive observers forms one of the meeting points between mystical/esoteric teachings and contemporary physics.",

    "description": "We return here to the theme of work, seen both in its literal sense and as a symbol of spiritual development. The man on the left is a sculptor, a master of his art. The card sometimes appears in connection with the Eight of Pentacles, signifying that the hard work and dedication have resulted or will result in mastery. To the right stand a monk and an architect holding the plans of the church. Together the three figures signify that the best work combines both technical skill (Air) and spiritual understanding (Water) with energy and desire (Fire). Observe how the pentacles form an upward pointing Fire triangle, showing that work can raise us to higher levels, while below them a flower sits within a downward pointing Water triangle, symbolizing the need to root such work in the reality of the world and the needs of the community. Reflecting this duality the card, like the Nine, refers to actual work yet may also stand as a symbol of the developed self. These two meanings do not cancel each other out. As observed earlier, practical work, done consciously and with commitment, may serve as the vehicle for self-development.",

More simply, it carries the idea of enjoying life, having a good time - similar to the Nine of Cups, but lighter, a dance more than a feast. Like so many Pentacles, the card implies a hidden magic in its ordinary pleasures. The juggler holds his magic emblems within a loop or ribbon shaped like an infinity sign, the same sign which appears above the head of the Magician, and the woman in Strength.

The Earth, in its completeness and solid reality, bears its own magic. We have seen with the other cards (primarily the Ten) how the magic will often remain hidden from us simply because we see its products as so ordinary. Here the hand gives its gifts in a garden, a place sheltered from the wilderness seen beyond it. Civilization, when it works well, gives us this basic protection. Through the work of civilization humanity shapes the raw material of nature into a safe and comfortable environment. Spiritual work leads us to recognize the magic in normal things, in both nature and civilization, and then to go beyond them to the greater knowledge symbolized by the mountains. The exit from the garden forms an arch very similar to the wreath of victory surrounding the World Dancer.

Taken another way the garden can sometimes stand for protection, either by events or other people, from the problems of life. Reversed then indicates that this protection has ended, and that the person must deal with her or his problems; or that the person wishes to hang on to this shelter after the time has come to leave it. Like the Hermit reversed, it can symbolize a refusal to grow up - specifically, to become independent of our parents.
