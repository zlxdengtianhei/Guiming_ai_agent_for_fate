The mask \n\nof ego must die. \n\nDramatic as it sounds this situation is actually very common, at \n\nleast in the need if not the fulfilment. Self-questioning and searching \n\nhave long been seen as features of middle age. When people are \n\nyoung they are concerned mainly with victory over the forces of life, \n\nfinding a partner and achieving success. When success has been \n\nfound, however, people may wonder about the value of it. The \n\nquestion, ‘Who am I beneath all my possessions, beneath all the \n\nimages I present to other people?’ takes on more and more \n\nimportance. Today, many younger people are not waiting for \n\nmiddle-age and success to ask these things. A characteristic of our \n\ntime is the desire for life to have a sense of meaning, of inner essence. \n\nAnd more and more people are deciding that the first place to look \n\nfor such meaning is within themselves. \n\nThis idea, in fact, is only a half-truth. The Magician teaches us \n\nthat, as physical beings, we find reality only in connection with the \n\nouter world; the inner truth of the High Priestess is a potential and \n\nmust be manifested through the consciousness of the Magician. But \n\nas long as our masks and habits and defences close us off from self- \n\nknowledge so that we never know why we act, then all the things we \n\ndo remain meaningless. The flow between the Magician and the \n\nHigh Priestess needs to be free for life to possess value. \n\nBecause the line basically reverses the emphasis of the first seven \n\ncards, many of the cards appear as mirror images to the ones above \n\nthem. The sexual polarity of trumps 1 and 2 become turned around \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n65 \n\nin Strength and the Hermit, while the principle of light and dark, \n\nouter and inner, remain in the same positions. The Wheel of \n\nFortune turns away from the natural and mindless world of the \n\nEmpress to a vision of inner mysteries. At the end of the line \n\nTemperance shows us a new kind of victory. The Chariot’s force has \n\nbeen replaced by balance and calm. W'here the charioteer’s stone \n\nchariot removed him from direct contact with the earth and the \n\nriver, the angel of Temperance stands with one foot on land, one in \n\nwater, showing the personality in harmony with itself and life. \n\nAnother theme appears in the second line. So far the cards have \n\npresented a series of lessons to us, things we must learn about life to \n\nbecome mature and successful in the outer world. But enlighten¬ \n\nment is a deeply personal experience. It cannot be studied or even \n\npondered but only lived. The series of outer lessons culminate in the \n\nWheel of Fortune which shows us a vision of the world and ourselves \n\nwhich must be answered. The Hanged Man, however, shows \n\nsomething else entirely. Here we see, not a lesson, but the image of \n\nenlightenment itself, the outer personality turned upside down by a \n\nvery- real and personal experience. \n\nIn between these two cards, and at the exact centre of the whole \n\nMajor Arcana, lies Justice, carefully balancing the scales between \n\ninner and outer, past and future, rationality and intuition, \n\nknowledge and experience. \n\n66 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nStrength \n\nWaite’s change of the Lovers was the most obvious of his Tarot \n\nalterations; his switch of Strength with Justice remains the most \n\ncontroversial. He himself gives no real reason for the change. ‘For \n\nreasons which satisfy myself, this card has been interchanged with \n\nthat of Justice, which is usually numbered eight. As the variation \n\ncarries nothing which will signify to the reader there is no cause for \n\nexplanation.’ The reasons are certainly more than personal. Not \n\nonly Waite but Paul Foster Case and Aleister Crowley placed \n\nStrength as 8 and Justice as 11. Probably they all followed the Order \n\nof the Golden Dawn, whose secret Tarot deck also switched the two \n\ncards. \n\nThis connection to a secret order suggests the idea of initiation. \n\nNow, the Golden Dawn, of course, did not originate the practice of \n\ninitiation, though it claimed to receive its specific rituals directly \n\nfrom spirit instructors. Initiation goes back thousands of years and is \n\nseen all over the world, from Egyptian temples to the Australian \n\ndesert. It represents a special means of psychological transformation \n\n- the very subject of the Tarot’s middle line. By referring Justice and \n\nthe cards around it to this ancient idea we gain a wider under¬ \n\nstanding of the Tarot as an experience. \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n67 \n\nIt is worth considering the implications of the old arrangement of \n\ntrumps. The image of Justice suggests weighing your life in the \n\nbalance. The second line takes us away from the outer achievements \n\nof the first and into the self. Thus Justice in the first position would \n\nmean an assessment of what your life has meant to you, followed by \n\na decision to search inward for greater meaning. Obviously, this fits \n\nvery nicely. But if Justice comes first then all these things occur \n\nrationally; the assessment arises as a conscious reaction to \n\ndissatisfaction. How much more powerful this assessment appears \n\nwhen it arises from within, forced on us by the powerful vision of the \n\nWheel of Fortune. The double-edged sword of Justice implies \n\naction, a response to the knowledge gained in the assessment. The \n\nidea of response leads directly to the Hanged Man. If Justice came \n\nfirst then the Hermit would follow it. As a seeker of wisdom the \n\nHermit would also represent a valid response to Justice. But again, if \n\nwe allow that wisdom to come before Justice, then the Hanged Man \n\nshows a response from deep inside. \n\nNow consider Strength in both places. The picture shows a \n\nwoman taming a lion. Briefly, the image suggests the energy of the \n\nunconscious released and calmed, ‘tamed’ by the direction of \n\nconscious understanding. Such an idea would easily belong in the \n\nmiddle position. We would then describe the card as the central test \n\nof the whole line. And certainly the peacefulness and great reversal \n\nof the Hanged Man would follow Strength perfectly. \n\nBut we can also see Strength as the qualities vital for beginning \n\nthe line. The search inward cannot be accomplished by the ego. We \n\nneed to confront feelings and desires long hidden from our conscious \n\nthoughts. If we attempt to transform ourselves by a wholly rational \n\nprocess we create another kind of persona. Something very like this \n\nin fact happens quite often. Many people feel a lack of spontaneity in \n\ntheir lives. They look around them or read books on psychology, and \n\nobserve, with a certain jealousy, or even shame at their own \n\nrepressions, the characteristics of spontaneous people. And then, \n\nrather than follow the fearful process of releasing their hidden fears \n\nand desires, they carefully imitate spontaneity. They have extended \n\nthe Chariot to a new domain. \n\nBy making Strength number 8 we set it against the Chariot, as a \n\ndifferent kind of power, not the ego’s will, but the inner Strength to \n\nconfront yourself calmly and without fear. The mysteries can be \n\nbrought out because we have found the Strength to face them. The \n\nlion signifies all the feelings, fears, desires, and confusions \n\nsuppressed by the ego in its attempt to control life. The charioteer \n\ndrew upon his inner feelings as a source of energy, but was always \n\n68 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\ncareful to direct that energy where he consciously decided it should \n\ngo. Strength allows the inner passions to emerge, as the first step in \n\ngoing beyond the ego. \n\nOn a very simple level we can see this emergence of suppressed \n\nfeelings in the person who allows him or herself to act ‘childishly’, to \n\nweep or scream; in short, to do all those things that previously \n\nseemed foolish or embarrassing. On a deeper level the lion \n\nsymbolizes the whole force of personality, usually smoothed over by \n\nthe demands of civilized life. Strength releases this energy in order to \n\nuse it as a kind of fuel, propelling us along the inner path of the \n\nHermit. This purpose can only be accomplished because the lion is \n\n‘tamed’ at the same time that it is released. Strength opens up the \n\npersonality like Pandora opening her box. It does so, however, with \n\na sense of peace, a love of life itself, and a great confidence in the \n\nfinal result. Unless we truly believe that the process of self-discovery \n\nis a joyous one we will never follow it through. \n\nThe symbolism of the pictures and numbers reinforces the \n\ncomparison of Strength and the Chariot. The Chariot shows a man \n\nand Strength shows a woman. Traditionally, of course, these \n\nrepresent rationality and emotion, aggression and surrender. Also \n\ntraditionally, the Chariot’s number 7 belongs to ‘male’ magic, the \n\nnumber 8 to ‘female’. This symbolism arises from anatomy. The \n\nmale body contains seven openings (counting the nose as one), the \n\nfemale eight. Also, the male body possesses seven points, the arms \n\nand legs, the head, the centre, and the penis. The female possesses \n\neight, the breasts replacing the penis. \n\nWhat do we mean by male and female magic? Esoteric theory \n\nconsiders sexual energy as a manifestation of the energy principles \n\nunderlying the entire universe; male and female being similar to the \n\npositive and negative poles of electro-magnetism. Through \n\nmanipulation of this bipolar energy, ‘magic’ power results. The \n\noccultist considers these principles a science, no more, and no less, \n\nmysterious than the modern scientist’s manipulation of atomic \n\nenergy. We can describe the Rider pack Lovers as a schematic \n\nenergy diagram. Therefore, the Chariot and Strength belong \n\ntogether esoterically as the practical manifestation of the principles \n\nsymbolized in the Magician and the High Priestess. \n\nPsychologically they also embody two kinds of power. Our society \n\nemphasizes the ‘masculine’ force of control; conquest, dominating \n\nthe world through reason and will. But the ‘feminine’ qualities of \n\nintuition and spontaneous emotion are far from weakness. To \n\nrelease your deepest emotions with love and faith requires great \n\ncourage as well as strength. \n\nThe Fool comes in here. Only by a kind of psychic leap can we \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n69 \n\nmove from the conscious to the unconscious. And only a fool would \n\nmake such a jump, for why give up success, control? The gods forced \n\nOedipus; what inner needs will force the rest of us? \n\nStrength’s position, as first in the line, links the card to the \n\nMagician, as does the infinity sign, another reference to 8, above her \n\nhead. The reversal of sex indicates a joining of aspects from both the \n\nmale and female archetypes. The Magician’s active involvement \n\nwith life has been modified by the inner peace implied in the High \n\nPriestess. \n\nThe woman’s sensual figure, her blonde hair, and the flower belt \n\nlinking her to the lion, connect the card to the Empress as well. The \n\nEmpress represents natural instincts and passion; again we see the \n\nimage of emotional energy, the ‘animal desires’ as some Tarot \n\ncommentators call it, released and tamed. Waite describes the \n\nflower belt as a second infinity sign, with one loop around the \n\nwoman’s waist, the other around the lion’s neck. We can describe \n\nStrength as the Magician united with the Empress; that is, the \n\nMagician’s power of consciousness and direction has mingled with \n\nthe Empress’s sensuality, giving it a sense of purpose and leading to \n\nthe Hermit. Notice that for the first line 1 plus 3 equals 4, the \n\nEmperor. For the second line 1 plus 3 becomes multiplied by 2; the \n\ninner truth of the High Priestess. \n\nAnother aspect of the trump carries this unity of 1 and 3 still \n\nfurther. The Hebrew letter given by Case and others to Strength is \n\nTeth. Teth refers Qabalistically to ‘snake’; but the Hebrew for snake \n\nalso means ‘magic’. All over the world people have made this \n\nconnection; from the snakes on Hermes’s magic wand to the \n\nkundalini power of Tantric occultism in India and Tibet. And the \n\nsnake, in kundalini and elsewhere, stands for sexuality. The Tarot, \n\nas we know from the serpent twined around the Tree of Life behind \n\nthe woman on the Lovers, considers sexuality to be a force towards \n\nenlightenment. If, esoterically, Strength stands for the actual \n\npractice of sexual magic, psychologically it refers again to releasing \n\nthat energy bound up in our strongest feelings. When we compare \n\nStrength with the Devil we will see that the release here is actually a \n\npartial one. The lion is controlled and directed rather than allowed \n\nto take the self wherever it wants to go. \n\nIn alchemy the lion stands for gold, the sun, and sulphur. Sulphur \n\nis a lower element and gold (in alchemy) the highest. The process by \n\nwhich sulphur becomes gold is precisely the process of transforming \n\nthe lower self. And the design of Temperance, the last card of the \n\nline, with its liquid poured from one cup to another, depicts the \n\nalchemical goal of blending the opposites into a new and more \n\nmeaningful existence. \n\n70 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nThose who find life a matter of strict control, who see the \n\nunconscious as a ‘moral sewer’ of repressions (as Jung characterized \n\nthe narrow Freudian view), and find the passions a torment, will see \n\nthe lion as natural forces which the rational mind must overcome. \n\nSome older Tarot decks, including the Visconti, showed Heracles \n\nkilling the Nemean lion. The passions conquered by reason. But the \n\nlion also stood for Christ, the radiant power of God. Those who \n\nallow the unconscious energy within themselves to emerge, guiding \n\nit with love and a faith in life, will discover that the energy is not a \n\ndestructive beast but the same spirit force drawn down through the \n\nlightning rod of the Magician. \n\nIn readings the card of Strength indicates the ability to face life, \n\nand particularly some difficult problem or time of change, with hope \n\nand eagerness. It shows a person strong from within, experiencing \n\nlife passionately yet peacefully, without being controlled or carried \n\naway by those passions. The card represents the finding of the \n\nstrength to begin or continue some difficult project, despite fear and \n\nemotional strain. \n\nIf Strength appears in connection with the Chariot it can signify \n\nan alternative to force and will-power, especially, of course, if the \n\nChariot is reversed. The two cards can also symbolize \n\ncomplementary sides, the best configuration being Strength in the \n\nposition of the inner self, and the Chariot in the position of the outer \n\n(the vertical and horizontal lines of a cross). Then we see a person \n\nwho acts powerfully but with a sense of calm. \n\nStrength reversed indicates first of all weakness. The courage to \n\nface life fails and the person feels overwhelmed and pessimistic. It \n\nsignifies also a torment from within. The bestial side of the lion \n\nbreaks away from the unity of spirit and sensuality. The passions \n\nbecome the enemy, threatening to destroy the conscious personality \n\nand the life it has built up for itself. \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n71 \n\nTHE HERMIT. \n\ni- \n\nFigure 10 \n\nThe Hermit \n\nLike the six-pointed star within the Hermit’s lantern, the idea of the \n\nHermit goes in two directions; one inner, one outer. Primarily the \n\ncard means a withdrawal from the outer world for the purpose of \n\nactivating the unconscious mind. We see this process symbolized in \n\nthe downward pointing ‘water’ triangle, as the alchemists called it. \n\nBut the Hermit also signifies a teacher who will show us how to \n\nbegin this process, and will help us find our way. The upward \n\npointing ‘fire’ triangle symbolizes this special guide, who might be \n\nan occult teacher, a therapist, our own dreams, or even a spirit guide \n\nevoked from within the self. \n\nThe image of the Hermit occupied a special place in the medieval \n\nimagination. Living in the woods or the desert, totally withdrawn \n\nfrom all the normal concerns of humanity, the hermit presented an \n\nalternative to the Church. The European version of a yogi ascetic, he \n\ndemonstrated the possibility of approaching God through personal \n\nexperience. People often looked upon the hermits as living saints, \n\nand attributed magic powers to them, in the way that yoga disciples \n\nwill tell wonderful stories about their masters. \n\nThough the hermit withdrew from society he or she 1 did not \n\n1 Women often became hermits and the medieval hatred of women sometimes became \n\na veneration of a particular woman who had supposedly conquered the evil of her sex. \n\n72 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nwithdraw from humanity. Among other functions, they gave shelter \n\nand sometimes blessings to travellers. Countless stories, especially \n\nthe Grail legends, depict the hermit who acts as a giver of wisdom to \n\nthe knight on a spiritual quest. Again, we see the Hermit’s double \n\nimage: example and guide. \n\nThe Hermit image has persisted long after the special practice has \n\ndied away. The transcendental philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson \n\ntravelled days through remote Scotland to find the cabin of Thomas \n\nCarlyle. Emerson’s friend, Henry David Thoreau, himself lived in a \n\ncabin at Walden Pond to find a sense of himself and of nature. He \n\nthen wrote about it as an example to others. Nietzsche’s Dus Sprach \n\n^arathustra enshrined the Hermit’s image; the book begins with \n\nZarathustra’s return after achieving personal transformation. And \n\ntoday, countless people have given themselves to Eastern gurus in \n\nthe hope that these hermit-like teachers can transform their lives. \n\nFor those who cannot find an actual guide the psyche will often \n\nprovide one. Jung and his followers have described their patients’ \n\nmany dreams of wise old men guiding them on mysterious journeys \n\ninto the psyche. In many cases dream analysis discovered that the \n\ndream guide actually stood for the therapist. The unconscious can \n\nrecognize a Hermit teacher before the conscious mind can. \n\nThe great thirteenth century Qabalist, Abraham Abulafia, \n\ndescribed three levels of Qabalah. The first was doctrine; that which \n\ncan be learned from texts. The second came from the direct \n\nguidance given by a personal teacher, while the third, the most \n\ndeveloped, was the direct experience of ecstatic union with God. \n\nThese three levels connect very directly to the Tarot, not only in the \n\nthree lines, but in three specific trumps which together form an \n\nisosceles triangle. The first level we see in the Hierophant; the third, \n\ndirectly below the Hierophant, one level removed, appears in the \n\njoyous child of card 19, the Sun. The second level, however, comes \n\nnot in the card between them, the Hanged Man, but on the other \n\nend of the pattern, as the second card in the second line, the Hermit. \n\nDoctrine and mystery both come as the end of a process; doctrine \n\nbecause you first must arrange your life before you can approach the \n\nstudy of a special way (Qabalists often restricted certain important \n\ntexts to people over thirty-five), and ecstasy because you first must \n\npass the archetypal confrontation with darkness and mystery. A \n\nguide, however, appears at the very start of the journey, after the \n\ntraveller has found the Strength to begin. \n\nAs an emblem of personal development, rather than a guide, the \n\nHermit signifies the idea that only by withdrawing from the outer \n\nworld can we awaken the inner self. Those who see the Tarot in two \n\nhalves, with the Wheel of Fortune as the mid-point, view the Hermit \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n73 \n\nas the period of contemplation before the Wheel of Life turns \n\ntowards its second half. When we view the Tarot in lines of seven we \n\nsee that this withdrawal, and the vision of the Wheel itself, are steps \n\ntowards a greater goal. \n\nWe see the Hermit on a cold lonely peak. He has left the world of \n\nthe senses to enter the mind. This image of the mind as stark and \n\nchill conveys only a partial truth, or rather, an illusion. The mind is \n\nrich with symbols, with joy, with the light and love of the spirit. But \n\nbefore we can apprehend these things we must first experience the \n\nmind as a silent alternative to the noisy world of the senses. For \n\nshamans the barren peak is often a direct reality. In places as far \n\napart as Siberia and the American South-West shaman candidates \n\ngo alone into the wilderness to seek the spirit guides who will teach \n\nthem how to heal. \n\nThe Hermit signifies a transition. Through the techniques of \n\nmeditation, or psychic discipline, or analysis, we allow the hidden \n\nparts of the psyche to begin to speak to us. Later we will experience \n\na sense of rebirth, first as an angel (the eternal part of the self, \n\nbeyond the ego), then later, more deeply felt, as a free child riding \n\nforth from the garden of past experience. For now, the path belongs \n\nto the image of the wise old man, alone, supported and warmed by \n\nhis stiff grey cloak of contemplation. \n\nThe symbol of the lantern returns us to the Hermit as guide and \n\nteacher. He tolds the light out to us, indicating his willingness to \n\nlead us and our ability to find the way if we will only use the \n\nStrength we have to follow. In some decks the Hermit conceals his \n\nlantern under his cloak, and then it symbolizes the light of the \n\nunconscious hidden under the cloak of the conscious mind. By \n\nmaking it visible, yet within a lantern, the Rider pack indicates that \n\nwe release the light through a definite process of self-awareness, and \n\nthat this process is available to anyone. \n\nWe have seen the star both as a symbol of the Hermit as teacher, \n\nand also as a light of the unconscious, beckoning us to discover its \n\nsecrets. It further signifies the goal of resolving the opposites of life. \n\nThe water and fire triangles traditionally represent not only two \n\nelements usually opposed, but also male and female united in a \n\nsingle form. \n\nThe Hermit’s staff suggests a wizard’s staff, and therefore the \n\nmagic wand of the Magician. Whereas the Fool used the wand \n\ninstinctively, the Hermit leans on it as a conscious support. It \n\ntherefore symbolizes the teaching which helps open the inner \n\nawareness. \n\nDirectly below the High Priestess the Hermit relates to her \n\nprinciple of withdrawal, indicating again that we must in some sense \n\n74 SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nleave the outer world if we wish to work on ourselves. As with \n\nStrength the second line reverses the sexual archetype. The role \n\nsymbolism here teaches us that a deliberate mental effort, based on \n\nspecific techniques and teachings, takes us beyond the locked up \n\nintuition of the High Priestess’s closed temple. The waters of that \n\ntemple are not fully released; the veii remains in place until the \n\nlightning of the Tower, below the Hermit, tears it open. Under the \n\ninfluence of trump 9, however, the unconscious speaks to us from \n\nbehind the veil, through symbols, dreams, and visions. \n\nThe distinction between male-female symbolism and the reality of \n\nindividual people leads us to some important realizations about \n\narchetypes. We tend to see hermits and teachers as wise old men, \n\neven in our dreams, because our two thousand year old patriarchy \n\nhas so impressed this image on our minds. In earlier times, the \n\nguides were most often women, as representatives of the Great \n\nGoddess, and even in our age such women as Madame Blavatsky \n\nhave served this ancient function. The fact that our dreams often \n\nchoose wise old men demonstrates the very important fact that the \n\nunconscious too draws its material from the cultural background of \n\nthe individual dreamer. Many people view archetypes as rigid fixed \n\nimages shared by all people at all times. Rather, archetypes are \n\ntendencies for the mind to form certain kinds of images, such as that \n\nof a guide, and the specific form an image takes will depend very \n\nmuch on a person’s cultural background and experience. Medieval \n\nGrail initiations and Australian desert rites follow the same \n\narchetypal pattern; it underlies them like a grid. Yet the outer form \n\nof that pattern varies immensely. \n\nThe divinatory meanings for the Hermit derive from both its \n\naspects. On the one hand it symbolizes a withdrawal from outer \n\nconcerns. The person may physically remove himself, but this is not \n\nreally necessary. What matters is the inner transfer of attention from \n\n‘getting and spending’ as Wordsworth called our worldly activities, \n\nto a person’s inner needs. It therefore requires an emotional \n\nwithdrawal from other people and from activities once thought to be \n\nall-important. The card carries within it a sense of deliberate \n\npurpose, of withdrawing to work on self-development. In connection \n\nwith this sense of purpose and with the picture of an old man the \n\ncard symbolizes maturity, and a knowledge of what really matters in \n\na person’s life. \n\nThe card can also signify assistance from a definite guide, \n\nsometimes, as indicated above, a psychic guide from within, but \n\nmore often a real person who will help you in your self-discoveries. \n\nSometimes we do not ourselves recognize that such a guide exists for \n\nus. If the Hermit appears in a Tarot reading it may be wise to look \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n75 \n\ncarefully at the people around you. If you are involved in helping \n\nothers find understanding then the Hermit can symbolize you in \n\nyour role as guide and teacher. \n\nWhen we reverse the card we corrupt the idea of withdrawal. In \n\nthe same way that the High Priestess reversed can mean a fear of \n\nlife, the Hermit reversed can indicate a fear of other people. If we \n\nwithdraw from society as a retreat then the fact of withdrawal \n\nbecomes more and more dominant, leading to phobias and \n\nparanoia. As with other trumps thfc negative and positive aspects of \n\nthe Hermit depend on the context. The Hermit reversed can \n\nsometimes simply mean that at this moment the person needs to \n\nbecome involved with other people. \n\nBecause the card, when the right way up, suggests maturity the \n\nHermit reversed can sometimes indicate a Peter Pan attitude to life. \n\nThe person hangs on to basically meaningless activities, or else \n\nimitates childlike enthusiasm (like the imitation of spontaneity) as a \n\nway of avoiding the responsibilities of doing something with his or \n\nher life. I first encountered this interpretation for the Hermit \n\nreversed in a reading given by a man in New York to a friend of \n\nmine; I have since found it useful in many situations. Interestingly, I \n\nmet the man through another friend who looked on the reader as a \n\npersonal guide in her spiritual development. \n\n76 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\n(a) (b) Figure 11 (c) \n\nThe Wheel of Fortune \n\nLike certain other trump cards (most notably Death) the Wheel of \n\nFortune derives from a medieval homily. The Church considered \n\npride the greatest of sins, for in pride you set yourself before Christ. \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n77 \n\nOne lesson against pride was the idea of a great king falling from \n\npower. In many versions of the King Arthur legend, the king dreams \n\nor sees before him on the eve of his final battle, a vision of a rich and \n\npowerful king seated on top of a wheel. All of a sudden the goddess \n\nFortuna turns the wheel and the king gets crushed at the bottom. \n\nSobered, Arthur realises that no matter how much secular power we \n\naccrue, our fate rests always in God’s hands. The Visconti cards, on \n\nthe right, above, enshrines this practical sermon. \n\nNow, we might consider this neat moral fable to be far removed \n\nfrom the powerful and mysterious symbols staring at us from the \n\nWaite-Smith card, on the top left, and the Oswald Wirth version on \n\nthe bottom left. But Fortuna and her shining hoop have a curious \n\nhistory. First of all, the medieval image derives from a much earlier \n\ntime, when Fortuna represented the Great Goddess, and the crushed \n\nking was a real event. Every year, at mid-winter, the priestesses \n\nsacrificed the king; by imitating the death of the year they humbled \n\nthemselves to the Goddess’s power, and by choosing a new king they \n\nsubtly suggested to her that she might once more create spring out of \n\nwinter - an event by no means automatic to people who did not \n\nbelieve in ‘natural laws’ such as gravity. Thus, the Wheel originally \n\nsymbolized both the mystery of nature and the human ability to take \n\npart in that mystery through a ritual sacrifice. Notice that the card \n\ncomes directly below the Empress, the emblem of the Great Mother \n\nherself. \n\nBy the Middle Ages the Wheel had lost its original meaning; this \n\ndid not mean that it had lost its power to suggest the mystery of life. \n\nIn Thomas Malory’s version of the King Arthur story we find the \n\nsuggestion that the Wheel symbolizes the random turnings of‘luck’. \n\nWhy do some people get rich and others poor? Why should a \n\npowerful king fall, and a formerly weak one rise to power? Who, or \n\nwhat, controls the turning wheel of life? Malory suggests that luck, \n\nseemingly meaningless ups and downs, is in reality fate; that is, the \n\ndestiny God has chosen for each individual, based on reasons only \n\nGod can understand. Because we cannot understand those reasons \n\nwe say that the events of people’s lives arise out of luck, but it all \n\nbelongs to God’s plan. \n\nWith the Wheel, therefore, we come to the great question of how \n\nand why anything happens at all in the universe. What makes the \n\nsun shine? Burning elements, yes, but what makes them burn? How \n\ndid atomatic energy come into existence? Why should spring follow \n\nwinter, after all? Why, and how, does gravity work? Going further, \n\nwe find that fate is also an illusion, a dodge to cover up the fact that \n\nwe, with our limited vision, cannot see the inner connection between \n\nall things. ‘Oh well,’ we say, ‘it’s fate’, a meaningless statement \n\n78 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nbecause we cannot understand the meaning. Things do not just \n\nhappen, they are made to happen. The power to shape events, to \n\ngive life and form and purpose to the universe, belongs, Malory tells \n\nus, to the Holy Ghost, dwelling in the physical world as a presence \n\nwithin the Holy Grail (the Ace of Cups) in the same way that the \n\nShekinah physically dwelt within the veiled sanctuary of the temple \n\nat Jerusalem. \n\nWe come then to the truth that both the random events of life and \n\nthe so-called ‘laws’ of the physical universe are mysteries leading us \n\nto an awareness of the spirit force drawn down by the upraised arm \n\nof the Magician and manifested in the natural world of the Empress. \n\nA great many mystics and shamans have said that their visions \n\nshowed them how all things connect, how everything fits together, \n\nbecause the spirit unites the entire universe. Possibly we would all \n\nsee and understand this grand scheme of life, if it were not for the \n\nfact that we do not live long enough. Our short lives narrow our \n\nvision to such a miniscule portion of the world that life appears \n\nmeaningless. \n\nNow, this idea of the Wheel as the mystery of fate, with its hidden \n\nmeaning, fits very well the modern Waite-Smith version of the card, \n\nespecially when we consider it as halfway to the final trump. If we \n\nplace the Rider pack Wheel beside the World we see immediately \n\nthe link between them. In one we have a wheel filled with symbols; \n\nin the other we find a wreath of victory, and inside it a dancer who \n\nembodies the truth behind the symbols. Even more striking, we find \n\nthe same four animals on each card in the corners, except that the \n\nmythological beings of card 10 have been transformed into \n\nsomething real and alive in the World. Thus, at the halfway point, \n\nwe receive a vision of the inner meaning of life; at the end that vision \n\nhas become real, embodied in our own being. \n\nIn India, the king also lost his life each year to the Goddess. When \n\nthe patriarchal Aryans ended this practice the image of the turning \n\nwheel of the year became an even more powerful symbol of the new \n\nreligion. The ever-turning Wheel of Life came to signify the laws of \n\nkarma, leading you to reincarnate in one body after another. Now, \n\nkarma is in a way simply another explanation for the mystery of fate. \n\nBy the actions you take in one life, you build up a certain destiny for \n\nyourself in the next, so that if you commit a great many evil deeds \n\nyou create in your immortal self a kind of psychic need for \n\npunishment. When the time comes for your next incarnation you \n\ninevitably choose a low caste or diseased body. (This simple \n\npsychological explanation of karma is perhaps based more on \n\nBuddhism than Hinduism.) \n\nAgain, our limited understanding prevents us from directly \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n79 \n\nexperiencing the truth behind the Wheel of Fate, or karma. When \n\nBuddha attained enlightenment he remembered every moment of \n\nevery one of his past lives. Indeed, the memory was the \n\nenlightenment. By gaining full knowledge he was able to perceive \n\nthat all those lives were only forms created by his desires. When he \n\nended his desires he ‘got off the Wheel*. We could say that \n\nenlightenment means (or includes, at any rate) piercing through the \n\nouter events to the spirit that dwells within them, that is, finding the \n\nHoly Ghost within the Wheel of Fortune. \n\nIt is significant that King Arthur experiences the Wheel of \n\nFortune as a vision in a dream. Because whether we see it as the \n\nhalfway point of the Major Arcana, or simply one of the steps to \n\ncompleting the second line, the Wheel is indeed a vision given to us \n\nby the unconscious. The Hermit has turned away from the outer \n\nworld. As a result the unconscious shows him a vision of life as a \n\nturning wheel filled with symbols. \n\nThe Wheel of Life does not become visible until we step away \n\nfrom it. When we are involved in it we see only the events \n\nimmediately before and behind us; the daily concerns our egos find \n\nso important. When we withdraw wx can see the whole pattern. \n\nPsychologically we can view this vision as an assessment a person \n\nmakes of where his or her life has gone and where it is going. On a \n\ndeeper level, the vision remains mysterious and symbolic. We can \n\nsee what we have made of our particular lives, but fate remains a \n\nmystery. \n\nThe symbols on the Wheel all possess meaning; they help us to \n\nunderstand the truth within the visions. Nevertheless, we do not \n\nexperience the full living force. The light of the unconscious remains \n\nveiled. \n\nIt is significant also that Malory connects the Wheel of Fortune to \n\nthe Holy Grail. For the Grail symbols, which are also the symbols of \n\nthe Minor Arcana, go back probably almost as far as the yearly \n\nregal sacrifice. When the candidate for initiation into the ancient \n\nEuropean mysteries was given his ‘vision’ of the inner secrets of the \n\ncult it was most likely the four symbols of the cup, the sword, the \n\nlance, and the pentacle, that were shown to him with great mystic \n\nceremony. And the basic tools of the ritual magic, laid on the \n\nMagician’s table, are the same four symbols and also the suits of the \n\nMinor Arcana. \n\nThough we do not see the four symbols directly on trump 10 we \n\ndo see two of their many analogues. The four creatures on the \n\ncorners of the card derive from the vision of Ezekiel 1:10. They \n\nappear also in Revelations 4:7. Now, over the centuries these four \n\nfigures, sometimes called the ‘guardians of heaven’ came to \n\n80 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nsymbolize the four basic elements of ancient and medieval science. \n\nFrom the right-hand corner anti-clockwise they are fire, water, air, \n\nand earth, and these elements belong as well to Wands, Cups, \n\nSwords, and Pentacles. Besides representing the elements the four \n\nbeasts also stand for the four fixed signs of the zodiac - Leo, Scorpio, \n\nAquarius, and Taurus. The zodiac, of course, is the Great Wheel of \n\nthe visible universe. Thus both the elements and the signs signify the \n\nphysical world, again seen as a mystery, and which can only be truly \n\nunderstood by learning the secret truths. \n\nThe other connection with the four elements comes in the four \n\nletter name of God on the Wheel’s rim. Beginning at the upper \n\nright-hand corner, and again reading anti-clockwise, the letters are, \n\nYod, Heh, Vav, Heh. Because this name appears in the Torah \n\nwithout vowels (the four letters are all consonants) it is \n\nunpronounceable; therefore God’s ‘true’ name remains a secret. For \n\nat least two thousand years Jews and Christians have seen this name \n\nas magical. Mystics meditate on it (Abulafia’s ecstatic third level of \n\nQabalah was reached through working with God’s name) and \n\nmagicians manipulate it. For Qabalists the four letters are the very \n\nsymbol of the world’s mysteries. The process of the universe's \n\ncreation was held to have occurred in four stages, corresponding to \n\nthe four letters. And of course, the letters also connect with the four \n\nelements, the Grail symbols, and the Minor Arcana. \n\nThe Roman letters interspersed between the Hebrew are an \n\nanagram. Read clockwise from the-top, they spell ‘TARO’; read \n\nanti-clockwise they form ‘TORA’ (remember the High Priestess's \n\nscroll). We can also find the words ‘ROTA’, Latin for ‘wheel’, \n\n‘ORAT’, Latin for ‘speaks’ and ‘ATOR\\ an Egyptian goddess (also \n\nspelled ‘Hathor’). Paul Foster Case, following MacGregor Mathers, \n\nfounder of the Golden Dawn, has formed the sentence ‘ROTA \n\nTARO ORAT TORA ATOR\\ This translates as, ‘The Wheel of \n\nTaro speaks the Law of Ator’. Case calls this the ‘law of letters’; \n\nsince Ator became best known in Egypt as a goddess of the dead, it \n\nis actually the ‘law’ of eternal life, concealed in the natural world. \n\nThough the body dies, the soul continues. Case also points out that \n\nthe Hebrew number values of the letters of‘TARO’ add up to 691, \n\nand that this, added to 26, the number value for the four letter name \n\nof God (called ‘Tetragrammaton’) makes 697. Those digits add up \n\nto 22, the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and of the \n\ntrumps in the Major Arcana. And of course 22 returns us to 4. \n\nThe four symbols on the spokes are alchemical. From the top, \n\nread in a clockwise direction, they are Mercury, sulphur, water, and \n\nsalt, and refer to the alchemical goal of line two, that is, \n\ntransformation. Water is the symbol for dissolution, that is, \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n81 \n\ndissolving the ego to release the true self that has become immersed \n\nin habits, fears, and defences. We will see just what this means when \n\nwe consider Death and Temperance. \n\nThe idea of death and rebirth is also symbolized in the creatures \n\nadorning the Wheel. The snake represents Set, the Egyptian god of \n\nevil, and legendary bringer of death into the universe. It is he who \n\nkills Osiris, god of life. It is very likely that this legend, like the \n\nW r heel itself, originated in the practice in pre-history of killing the \n\ngod-king, especially when we consider that Set was once a hero god, \n\nand that the snake was sacred to the Goddess who would have \n\nreceived the sacrifice. The snake follows the Wheel down; the jackal¬ \n\nheaded man going up is Anubis, guide to the dead souls s and \n\ntherefore giver of new life. Now, according to some legends Anubis is \n\nSet’s son, and so we see that only death can bring new lifo, and when \n\nwe fear death we are seeing only a partial truth. Psychologically, \n\nonly the death of the outer self can release the life energy within. \n\nThe sphinx on top of the Wheel represents Horus, Osiris’s son, \n\nand god of resurrection (in later centuries often replaced by Ator). \n\nLife has triumphed over death. But the sphinx, as we saw in the \n\nChariot, also signifies the mystery of life. The Chariot controlled life \n\nwith a strong ego. Now the sphinx has risen above the Wheel. If we \n\nallow the unconscious to speak we will sense some great secret to \n\nlife, more important than the endless round of apparently \n\nmeaningless events. \n\nSet, the snake, was also called god of darkness. Again, to see \n\ndarkness as ‘evil’ is an illusion, and indeed, the fear of darkness, like \n\nthe fear of death, belongs to the ego. The ego loves the light just as \n\nthe unconscious loves the dark. In light everything is simple and \n\nstraightforward; the ego can occupy itself with the sense impressions \n\nfrom the outer world. When darkness comes the unconscious begins \n\nto stir. That is why children see monsters at night. One reason we \n\nmake the outer self so strong is so we will not face demons every time \n\nthe lights go out. \n\nThose, however, who wish to go beyond the Chariot must face \n\nthose terrors. Snakes and water, darkness and dissolution are all \n\nsymbols of death, that is, death of the body and death of the ego. But \n\nlife exists before and after the individual personality, which, of \n\ncourse, is only a bubble on the surface of our selves. Life is powerful, \n\nchaotic, surging with energy. Give way to it and Horus, the god of \n\nresurrection, will bring new life out of the chaos. The Wheel turns \n\nup as well as down. \n\nThe W'irth version of the Wheel of Fortune proclaims this idea \n\neven more strongly. The Wheel rests on a boat in water. Dissolution, \n\nchaos, emerge as the essential reality underlying the physical \n\n82 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nuniverse. All the forms of existence, the great variety of things and \n\nevents, are simply momentary creations out of that powerful energy \n\nthat fills the cosmos. In Hindu myth Shiva periodically destroys the \n\nentire universe, when the outer forms, like the ego, have grown \n\nweary and dull, by releasing the basic energy from which the \n\nuniverse originally emerged. \n\nThe number 10 suggests 0. The Fool is nothing and has no \n\npersonality. But the Fool, like the number 0, is also everything, \n\nbecause he feels directly that energy of life, that sea surging beneath \n\nthe boat. On the Rider pack Wheel of Fortune the centre of the \n\nWheel bears no symbol. When we come to the still centre of \n\nexistence, without ego or fear, all the outer forms vanish. We can \n\nunderstand this intuitively, but to really experience it we must allow \n\nourselves to descend into that dark sea, to let the personality die, \n\ndissolve, and give way to the new life emerging out of darkness. \n\nIn divinatory readings the Wheel of Fortune signifies some change \n\nin the circumstances of a person’s life. The person would likely not \n\nunderstand what has caused this change; there might be no direct \n\nreason that anyone can see, and in fact the person is likely not to be \n\nresponsible in any normal sense of the word. A large corporation \n\nbuys the company a man works for, and he becomes redundant. A \n\nlove affair ends, not because the people have made any ‘mistakes’ in \n\ntheir treatment of each other, but simply because life continues. The \n\nWheel turns. \n\nThe important thing about change is the reaction. Do we accept \n\nthe new situation and adapt to it? Do we use it as an opportunity \n\nand find some meaning and value in it? If the Wheel appears the \n\nright way up it signifies adaptation. In its strongest sense it can \n\nindicate the ability to pierce through the mystery of events to find a \n\ngreater understanding of life. The end of a love affair, despite its \n\npain, can give greater self-knowledge. \n\nReversed, the card signifies a struggle against events, usually \n\ndoomed because the change has happened and life will always win \n\nagainst the personality that tries to oppose it. If the person \n\nconcerned, however, has always reacted passively to whatever life \n\nhas done to him or her, then the W'heel reversed can signify a more \n\nimportant change than simply a new set of circumstances. It can \n\nopen the way to a new awareness of responsibility for your own life. \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n83 \n\nJUSTICE . \n\nFigure 12 \n\nJustice \n\nThe image of this trump derives from the Greek Titaness Themis, \n\nwho appears, with her blindfold and scales, on court house frescoes \n\nthroughout the Western world. The legal Justitia, to give her her \n\nLatin name, was blindfolded to demonstrate that the law does not \n\ndiscriminate and applies to weak and powerful alike. The principle \n\nof social justice, however, properly belongs to the Emperor, directly \n\nabove Justice. Card 11 indicates that the psychic laws of Justice, by \n\nwhich we advance according to our ability to understand the past, \n\ndepends on seeing the truth about ourselves and about life. The \n\nTarot Justitia, therefore, wears no blindfold. \n\nSo far, we have spoken of the second line as a process of \n\nwithdrawal from outer concerns to awaken the inner vision of \n\nourselves and of life. But a vision of the underlying nature of things is \n\nmeaningless if it does not produce an active response. We must \n\nalways act (the Magician principle) on the wisdom received from \n\nthe inner self (the High Priestess principle). Not just the perfectly \n\nbalanced scales but all the images on the card point to an \n\nequilibrium between understanding and action. The figure, a \n\nwoman, appears androgynous; though she sits firmly on her stone \n\nbench she looks poised to stand; one foot points outward from her \n\nrobe, the other remains hidden. The sword, an emblem of action, \n\n84 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\npoints straight upward, indicating both resolve and the idea that \n\nwisdom is like a sword piercing through the illusion of events to find \n\nthe inner meaning. Two-edged, the sword signifies choice. Life \n\nrequires us to make decisions; at the same time each decision, once \n\nmade, cannot be revoked. It becomes part of us. We are formed by \n\nthe actions we have taken in the past; we form our future selves by \n\nthe actions we take now. \n\nThe scales also represent the perfect balance of past and future. \n\nPast and future balanced, not in time, but in the clear sight of \n\nJustice staring out at you from the exact centre of the Major Arcana. \n\nThroughout the first half of the Major Arcana, when a person \n\ninvolves himself in the outer world, he suffers from the illusion that \n\nhe is living life on the active principle. This is because we confuse \n\ndoing things with action. As we turn inwards we assume we turn \n\naway from action; and indeed the process of line two cannot be \n\naccomplished without a pause in our outer lives, or at least a shift in \n\nattention. But real action, as opposed to pointless movement, always \n\nbrings meaning and value to our lives; such action comes out of \n\nunderstanding. Otherwise, we remain ruly passive, machines being \n\npushed from one event to the next with no understanding of what \n\ncauses us to do the things we do. The true purpose of line two is not \n\nto abandon thp active principle but to awaken it. \n\nThe imagery of trump 11 combines the Magician and the High \n\nPriestess more completely than ever before. First of all, the digits of \n\nnumber 11 add up to 2, but the number also signifies a higher \n\nversion of 1 (as well as a lesser version of 21). The woman seated \n\nbefore two pillars with a veil between them suggests the High \n\nPriestess, but her red robe, and her posture, one arm up, one arm \n\ndown, implies the Magician. True action arises from self- \n\nknowledge; wisdom arises out of action. In life, as in the picture, the \n\nMagician and the High Priestess are inextricably combined, like a \n\nmale and female snake twined around each other (symbol of the \n\nkundalini as well as the caduceus of Hermes), or the double helix of \n\nDNA. Hie colour of the veil is purple, emblem of inner wisdom; \n\nbackground, crown, hair, and scales are all yellow, signifying mental \n\nforce. Wisdom does not arise spontaneously. We must think about \n\nour lives if we wish to understand them. But all our thinking goes \n\nnowhere unless it develops out of a clear vision of the truth. \n\nOn the microcosmic level of personal psychology the Wheel of \n\nFortune represented a vision of a person’s life; the events, who you \n\nare, what you’ve made of yourself. Justice indicates an \n\nunderstanding of that vision. The way to understanding lies in \n\nresponsibility. As long as we believe that our past lives just happen, \n\nthat we do not bring our own selves into existence through every \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n85 \n\nthing we do, then the past remains a mystery, and the future an \n\nendlessly turning wheel, empty of meaning. But when we accept \n\nthat every- event in our lives has helped to form our characters, and \n\nthat in the future we will continue to create ourselves through our \n\nactions, then the sword of wisdom cuts through the mystery. \n\nFurther, by accepting responsibility for ourselves we \n\nparadoxically free ourselves from the past. Like Buddha \n\nremembering all his lives, we can only get loose from the past by \n\nbecoming conscious of it. Otherwise we constantly repeat past \n\nbehaviour. This is why Justice belongs in the centre of our lives. The \n\nego may be only a persona, a kind of mask, but that mask can \n\ncontrol us as long as we will not admit having forged it ourselves. \n\nThe idea of responsibility for your own life does not imply any sort \n\nof invisible control over the outer world. It does not mean, for \n\ninstance, that if an earthquake destroys your house you have \n\nsomehow willed this to happen, for whatever hidden reasons of your \n\nown. Understanding includes accepting the limitations of your \n\nphysical existence. The universe is vast and strange, and no \n\nindividual can control what happens in it. \n\nNor does responsibility imply anything moral. It simply means \n\nthat, like it or not, whatever you do, whatever you experience, \n\ncontributes to the development of your personality. Life demands \n\nthat you respond to every event. Not a moral requirement, just a fact \n\nof existence. \n\nAnd yet all our instincts, psychology, and religion, as well as the \n\ntestimony of mystics, tells us that life contains something more, an \n\ninner core independent of that outer self thrown from one experience \n\nto another. The second line shows the outer personality dying and \n\nthe inner core, the angel of Temperance, being allowed to emerge. \n\nBefore such a release can happen we must accept the ‘justice’ of our \n\nlives; what we are we have made ourselves. \n\nOur age sees this process of awareness as primarily psychological, \n\nbest exemplified in the difficult process of psychoanalysis. Other \n\nages have externalized the process of transformation in the dramatic \n\nrituals of initiation. All initiations follow the same pattern. Having \n\ngathered his or her courage to become a neophyte the candidate first \n\nreceives instruction in the teaching of the cult or mystery; during \n\nthis time steps are taken, through meditation, ritual and drugs, to \n\nopen the channels to the unconscious and make the person \n\nreceptive. These first stages are symbolized in Strength and the \n\nHermit. Then, in a great atmosphere of mystery and drama, the \n\ncandidate is shown a vision of the cult’s secret mysteries. (They are \n\nkept secret partly to protect them from unbelievers, but even more to \n\nmake them effective when revealed.) In the Grail cults this vision \n\n86 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nwas a dramatic procession of the Grail and its attendant symbols, \n\ncarried by women weeping for a wounded king. We see an analogue \n\nof this vision in the Wheel of Fortune. \n\nAnd now comes the crucial moment. The candidate must make a \n\nresponse. If he or she simply stands there passively waiting for the \n\nnext events, then the initiation cannot continue. In the Grail cults \n\nthe necessary response was most likely a question, either ‘What is \n\nthe meaning of these things?’ or more subtly, ‘Whom does the Grail \n\nserve?’ By asking this question the candidate gives the cult a chance \n\nto answer, that is, to continue the initiation through the ritual death \n\nand rebirth. More important, he or she shows a recognition of being \n\npart of the process, responsible for its proper outcome. This is more \n\ndifficult than it sounds. The ritual symbolizes the life, death, and \n\nrebirth of nature, as well as the body dying to release the eternal \n\nsoul. To speak at such an awesome event (and remember that the \n\ninitiate believed in his or her gods and goddesses in a way impossible \n\nfor most of us today) required a courage at least as great as that \n\nneeded to accept the truths revealed through psychological analysis \n\nand awakening. \n\nIn our time the emphasis on individualism leads us to think only \n\nof personal death and rebirth. The great iniations, on the other \n\nhand, served not only to transform the particular person, but also \n\nlinked him or her to the wider mysteries of the universe. Following \n\nthis lead we can see another reason why Justice belongs in the centre \n\nof the Major Arcana. We have spoken of the world as a great inter¬ \n\nplay of opposites, a constantly turning wheel of light and dark, life \n\nand death. We have also said that at the centre of the wheel is the \n\nstationary point around which the opposites endlessly revolve. The \n\nbalanced scales of Justice again suggest that stationary point. When \n\nwe find the centre of our lives everything comes into balance. When \n\nall the opposites, including past and future, come into balance we \n\nare able to be free within ourselves. \n\nMany people wonder what the Tarot, or the I Ching, or astrology \n\ntell us about free will. If the cards can predict what we will do, does \n\nthat mean free will does not really exist? The question arises from a \n\nmisunderstanding of free will itself; we think of it as something \n\nsimple and independent of the past. At any moment, we think, we \n\nare free to do whatever we want. But our supposedly free choices are \n\ngoverned by our past actions. If we do not understand ourselves, \n\nhow can we expect to make a free choice? Only by seeing and \n\naccepting the past can we free ourselves from it. \n\nA person may ask the cards about some situation. The cards very \n\ndirectly outline the consequences of some decision, say, whether or \n\nnot to go ahead with a love affair, or to start some new project. Let \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n87 \n\nus say that the cards indicate disaster, and that the person really can \n\nsee the likelihood of what the cards predict. Now the person might \n\nsay, ‘Well, this is likely, but my free will allows me to change the \n\nsituation’. So he or she goes ahead and the situation turns out \n\nexactly as the cards predicted. The person has not really used free \n\nwill at all; rather, the idea of free will has served as an excuse for \n\nignoring what he or she recognized as a valid projection. This is not \n\na hypothetical situation; it happens again and again with Tarot \n\nreadings. It is not enough just to foresee a likely outcome for us to \n\nchange or prevent that event. We must understand why it is coming, \n\nand we must work on the causes within ourselves for the things we \n\ndo and the ways we react. Free will certainly exists. We just do not \n\nknow how to use it. The most important thing we can learn from \n\nTarot readings is just how little we exercise our freedom. \n\nIn Tarot readings one should always pay very careful attention to \n\nthe card of Justice. Its appearance indicates first of all that events \n\nhave worked out in the way they were ‘meant’ to work out; that is, \n\nwhat is happening to you comes from situations and decisions in the \n\npast. You have what you deserve. Secondly it indicates a need and a \n\npossibility for seeing the truth of this outcome. The card signifies \n\nabsolute honesty. At the same time it shows the possibility that your \n\nactions in the future can be changed by a lesson learned in the \n\npresent situation. \n\nWe cannot become honest with ourselves without extending that \n\nhonesty to our dealings with other people. In this sense the card \n\ncarries the obvious meanings of Justice; honesty, fairness, correct \n\nactions, and of course, in legal and other matters, a just decision - \n\nthough not necessarily the decision a person might prefer. \n\nReversed, the card indicates dishonesty with yourself and others. \n\nIt shows an unwillingness to see the meaning of events and shows \n\nespecially that you are missing some opportunity for a greater \n\nunderstanding of yourself and your life. On the outer level it \n\nindicates dishonesty and unfair actions or decisions. Sometimes it is \n\nothers who are unfair to us. The reversed meaning can refer also to \n\nunjust legal decisions or to bad treatment from someone. \n\nOn the other hand we must not allow the suggestion of unfairness \n\nto act as an excuse for denying our own responsibility for what \n\nhappens to us. Justice reversed sometimes reflects the attitude, ‘It is \n\nunfair. Look how everybody treats me’. And on and on. Whether the \n\nright way up or reversed the clear eyes of Justice send us an \n\noverwhelming message. In the words of Emerson, ‘Nothing can save \n\nyou but yourself’. \n\n88 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\n(a) Figure 13 (b) \n\nThe Hanged Man \n\nAfter the crisis of seeing what you have made of your life comes the \n\npeace of acceptance; after Justice, the Hanged Man. Artists, writers, \n\nand psychologists have all felt drawn to this card, with its hints of \n\ngreat truths in a simple design. We have already referred to the \n\noccult tradition behind the upside down posture and crossed legs. In \n\ndiscussing Strength we said that occultists seek to release the energy \n\nof the desires and transform it into spiritual energy. Many occultists \n\nparticularly the alchemists, have believed that one very direct way to \n\ndo this is literally to stand on your head, so that gravity will pull \n\ndown the energy from the genitals to the brain. Of course, only the \n\nmost naive and optimistic alchemist would have expected such a \n\nthing to literally happen. They may have believed that trace \n\nelements found in genital fluid will seep down and affect the brain; \n\nmore to the point, the reversal of physical posture serves as a very \n\ndirect symbol of the reversal of attitude and experience that comes \n\nthrough spiritual awakening. Where everyone else is frenzied, you \n\nwill know peace. Where other people believe themselves to be free, \n\nbut are actually pushed from one thing to another by forces they do \n\nnot understand, you will achieve true freedom by understanding and \n\nembracing those forces. \n\nThe Hanged Man hangs on a tree shaped like the letter T. Now, \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n89 \n\nthis is the bottom half of an ankh, Egyptian symbol of life and is \n\nsometimes called a Tau cross. According to Case the ankh in Egypt \n\nstood for the Hebrew letter Tau, which is the letter belonging to the \n\nWorld. Thus, the Hanged Man lies halfway to the World. We see \n\nthis as well in the fact that 12 is 21 backwards, and if you turn the \n\nHanged Man upside down (making the man himself right side up) \n\nyou will have almost the same figure as the World Dancer. When we \n\nask. therefore, what card serves as the halfway point for the Major \n\nArcana, the answer is not one but three - the Wheel, Justice, and the \n\nHanged Man, symbolizing a process rather than a moment. \n\nNotice that while the Dancer extends her arms with their magic \n\nwands the Hanged Man keeps his arms crossed behind his back. \n\nRemember also that he is upside down. At this stage a deep spiritual \n\nawareness can only be maintained by withdrawing from society. In \n\nthe World we see that same awareness maintained amidst all the \n\nouter activities of life. \n\nHe hangs on an ankh, which makes his tree the Tree of Life. \n\nRecalling Odin sacrificing himself on Yggdrasil we can also call the \n\ngallows the World Tree. This tree begins in the underworld (the \n\nunconscious), and reaches up through the physical world (the \n\nconscious) to heaven (the super-conscious). The ideas first \n\nrepresented by the diagram of the Lovers have begun to actually \n\nhappen. What we saw previously as concepts now becomes, after \n\nJustice, a genuine experience. The Hanged Man’s number, 12, is 2 \n\ntimes 6, that is, the High Priestess raising the Lovers to a higher \n\nlevel. \n\nBeyond all its symbolism the Hanged Man affects us because it \n\nshows a direct image of peace and understanding. The calm shows \n\nso strongly in the card because the Hanged Man has surrender \n\ninvolved joining the rituals instead of just watching them. For many \n\nmodern people it involves releasing the emotions they have locked \n\nup for years. Notice that both these things are acts; surrender to the \n\nWorld Tree is an actual step we take, not a passive waiting. \n\nT.S. Eliot’s poem The Wasteland links the idea of an individual \n\nsurrender to emotions with both the barrenness of European life \n\nafter World War I and the ancient Grail mysteries. The wounded \n\nFisher King can be healed by a ‘moment’s surrender which an age of \n\nprudence can never retract’. Earlier in the poem the hero is told \n\n‘Fear death by drowning’. The ego sees surrender as death - \n\ndissolution in the sea of life. The person who gives this warning is a \n\nTarot reader. Eliot’s poem helped to popularize Tarot cards in the \n\n1920s. Specifically, it made famous the Hanged Man. Actually, the \n\nHanged Man does not appear in the poem but is important because \n\nof his absence. \n\n90 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nEliot claimed to really know nothing of the Tarot, but only to use \n\nsome images from it. Apparently, however, he knew at least one \n\nesoteric fact unknown to even many Tarot commentators - that, \n\naccording to some esoteric writers the Hanged Man ‘originally’ bore \n\nthe title, ‘The Drowned Phoenician Sailor’. Madame Sosostris \n\napplies this title to the hero. ‘This is your card.’ Surrender is his \n\ndestiny, but he has denied it: ‘I do not find the Hanged Man.’ \n\nThe crossed legs represent the number 4 upside down. 4 \n\nsymbolizes the earth with its four directions. By reversing his own \n\nsense of values the Hanged Man has turned the world on its head. \n\nThe arms and head together form a downward pointing water \n\ntriangle. The way to the super-conscious is through the unconscious. \n\nThe Golden Dawn card on the right of the Rider version shows the \n\nHanged Man suspended over water. Most Tarot Qabalists assign \n\nthe letter ‘Mem’ to this card. Mem stands for ‘seas’ or the element of \n\nwater. \n\nWe therefore see 4, the world, consciousness, and 3, here \n\nrepresenting water, or the unconscious, in the Hanged Man’s body. \n\nThese numbers multiplied form 12. In multiplication the original \n\nnumbers become dissolved and form something greater than their \n\nsum. \n\nThe number 12, like 21, suggests both 1 and 2. The card reflects \n\nthe Magician in the sense that the power drawn down by the wand \n\nhas now entered the Hanged Man; we see it as the circle of light \n\nabout his head. The experience of really feeling the spirit force \n\nwithin life is one of great power and excitement in the midst of \n\ncomplete calm. The number 2 suggests the High Priestess; so does \n\nthe image of water. Both cards indicate a withdrawal, but where \n\ntrump 2 indicated the archetype of receptivity, trump 12 shows an \n\nexperience of it. \n\n1 plus 2 equals 3. The Empress directly felt life through emotional \n\ninvolvement, the Hanged Man feels it through inner awareness. \n\nIn readings the Hanged Man bears the message of independence. \n\nLike the Fool, which signified doing what you sensed was best, even \n\nif other people thought it foolish, the Hanged Man indicates being \n\nwho you are, even if others think you have everything backwards. It \n\nsymbolizes the feeling of being deeply connected to life and can \n\nmean a peace that comes after some difficult trial. \n\nThe trump reversed indicates an inability to get free of social \n\npressure. Rather than listen to our inner selves we do what others \n\nexpect or demand of us. Our awareness of life always remains \n\nsecond-hand, never a direct experience but only a series of \n\nstereotypes, like the person who models his or her behaviour on the \n\norders of parents and the actions of movie stars. \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n91 \n\nThe card reversed also means fighting your inner self in some \n\nway. It can mean the person who tries to deny some basic part of \n\nhimself or simply the person who cannot accept reality and who in \n\nsome way or other is constantly battling life. By putting his or her \n\nego against the world this person too never fully experiences life. \n\nNone of us can know the full meaning of being alive until, like Odin, \n\nwe hang ourselves on the World Tree, its roots deep beyond \n\nknowledge in the sea of experience, its branches lost among the \n\nendless stars. \n\n(a) • Figure 14 (b) \n\nDeath \n\nAs much as the Lovers (directly above Death) Arthur Waite’s design \n\nfor trump 13 departs from standard Tarot imagery. The picture on \n\nthe right, above, comes from the esoteric Golden Dawn Tarot, but, \n\neven so, illustrates the older, essentially social message of Death. \n\nDeath strikes everyone, kings and commoners alike. This basic \n\ndemocracy of death was a favourite theme of medieval sermons. As \n\nan idea it goes back at least as far as the Jewish practice of burying \n\neveryone in the same style, a white shroud and a plain pine box, so \n\nthat in death rich become level with the poor. \n\nAs we might guess, the great power of death leads us beyond \n\ndemocracy to both philosophical and psychological meanings. \n\nDeath, like life, is eternal and always present. Individual forms are \n\n92 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nalways dying while others come into existence. Without death to \n\nclear away the old, nothing new could find a place in the world. \n\nMany science fiction novels have shown the tyrannical society that \n\nwould result if the world’s leaders did not die. The liberation of \n\nSpain after the death of Franco aptly demonstrated death’s \n\nimportance. \n\nWhen we die our flesh decays, leaving only the skeleton. That too \n\nwill eventually pass but it lasts long enough to at least hint at \n\neternity. Therefore, the skeleton in the Golden Dawn card implies \n\nthat eternity triumphs over the transitory. Now, the skeleton has an \n\noccult meaning as well. All over the world the training for shamans \n\nincludes methods of seeing one’s own skeleton, using drugs, \n\nmeditation, even scraping the skin off the face. By freeing the bone \n\nfrom the flesh shamans connect themselves to eternity. \n\nBecause people fear death they seek reason and value in it. The \n\nChristian religion teaches us that death liberates our souls from the \n\nsinful flesh so that we may join God in a greater life to come. Carl \n\nJung has written of the value of believing in an afterlife. Without it, \n\ndeath may seem too monstrous to accept. \n\nOther people have pointed out that death joins us to nature. The \n\nconsciousness that isolates us from the world will be obliterated; \n\nthough the body will decay, that only means that it is feeding other \n\ncreatures. Each death brings new life. Many people find the notion \n\nof themselves being eaten horrible to contemplate. The modern \n\npractice of embalming and painting corpses so that they look alive, \n\nand then of burying them in sealed metal caskets derives from the \n\ndesire to maintain the body’s separateness from nature even in \n\ndeath. \n\nThe fact is, since we will not know what happens to our bodies \n\nonce the spirit has left them, what we really fear is the destruction of \n\nthe personality. It is the ego that sees itself as separate from life; \n\nbecause it is only a mask the ego does not wish to die. It wishes to \n\nmake itself superior to the universe. \n\nIf we can accept death we will be able to live more fully. The ego \n\nnever wants to release energy; it tries to hoard it against the fear of \n\ndeath. As a result new energy cannot get in. We see this very \n\ngraphically in peoples breathing when they panic. They try to gulp \n\nair in without letting any out and as a result become short of breath. \n\nIn sex too the ego hoards energy. It fights climax and surrender \n\nbecause at that moment the ego partly dissolves. In Elizabethan \n\nEngland sexual intercourse was often called ‘dying’. And Death in \n\nthe Tarot comes below the Lovers. \n\nBecause the ego resists the very idea of death and therefore keeps \n\nus from enjoying life we must sometimes take extreme steps to get \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n93 \n\npast it. The initiation rites always led up to a simulated death and \n\nrebirth. The initiate is led to believe that he or she is actually about \n\nto die. Everything is done to make this death as real as possible so \n\nthat the ego will be tricked and in fact experience that dreaded \n\ndissolution. Then, when the initiate is ‘reborn’ he or she experiences \n\na new maturity and a new freedom of energy. In recent years many \n\npeople have experienced something very like these rites through \n\nusing psychedelic drugs. They believe they are dying and they feel \n\nthemselves reborn. However, without the preparation symbolized in \n\nthe Hanged Man the experience can often be deeply disturbing. \n\nContrary to what many people believe the card of Death does not \n\nactually refer to transformation. Rather, it shows us the precise \n\nmoment at which we give up the old masks and allow the \n\ntransformation to take place. Perhaps we can understand this better \n\nif we consider the Tarot’s parallel in psychotherapy. By force of will \n\n(Strength) the person, with the help of the therapist-guide (the \n\nHermit), allows knowledge to emerge of who he or she really is, and \n\nwhat habits or fears he or she wishes to shed (Wheel and Justice). \n\nThis knowledge brings calm and a desire to change (the Hanged \n\nMan). But then a fear sets in. ‘If I give up my behaviour’, the person \n\nthinks, ‘maybe there will be nothing left. I will die.’ We live under \n\nthe ego’s control for so many years we come to believe that nothing \n\nelse exists. The mask is all we know. Often people will stay stuck in \n\ntherapy for years because they fear release. The nothingness of the \n\nFool terrifies them. \n\nPeople who have been fat for years often experience a similar fear \n\nif they try to diet. ‘I have always been fat’, they think. ‘I am a fat \n\nperson. If I get skinny I will not exist any more.’ The fact is, this is \n\ntrue. The ‘I* that was a fat person will no longer exist. But \n\nsomething else will emerge. \n\nThe Waite image for trump 13 increases the psychological \n\nmeaning of the card. The four people demonstrate different \n\napproaches to change. The king, struck down, shows the rigid ego. If \n\nlife comes at us with enough power the ego may collapse; insanity \n\ncan result from an inability to adjust to extreme change. The priest \n\nstands and faces Death directly; he can do so because his stiff robes \n\nand hat protect him and support him. We see here the value of a \n\ncode of belief to help us past our fears of death. The Maiden \n\nsymbolizes partial innocence. The ego is not rigid, yet still aware of \n\nitself, unwilling to surrender. Therefore she kneels but turns away. \n\nOnly the child, representing complete innocence, faces Death with a \n\nsimple offering of flowers. \n\nDeath wears black armour. We have already seen how blackness \n\nand darkness symbolize the source of life as well as its end. Black \n\n94 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nabsorbs all colour; death absorbs all individual lives. The skeleton \n\nrides a white horse. White repels all colours and therefore \n\nsymbolizes purity, but also nothingness. The white rose stands for \n\nthe desires purified, for when the ego dies selfish and repressive \n\nneeds die with it. \n\nAt the back of the card we see a sun rising between two pillars. \n\nThe ego belongs to the outer world of duality, separating and \n\ncategorizing experience. Through Death we feel the radiant power \n\nof Life, which knows only itself. The landscape before the pillars \n\nreminds us of the ‘land of the Dead’ described in all mythologies. \n\nWe fear the death of our old selves because we do not know what to \n\nexpect afterwards. One main function of those shamans who see \n\ntheir skeletons is to go ahead through the Land of the Dead and thus \n\nbe able to guide the souls of others. \n\nA river flows through the middle of the card. Rivers, as we saw \n\nwith the Empress, indicate the unity of change and eternity. The \n\nfact that they lead to the sea reminds us of the formlessness and \n\noneness of the universe. The boat, reminiscent of the Pharaohs’ \n\nburial boats, symbolizes the true self carried through Death to a new \n\nlife. \n\nNo matter the picture, all Tarot cards bear the number 13. \n\nThough most people consider 13 unlucky they do not know why. In \n\nour culture 13 refers to Judas, since he was the thirteenth man at the \n\nLast Supper, and therefore the number indicates Christ’s (and all \n\npeople’s) death. Friday the thirteenth is especially unlucky because \n\nChrist died on a Friday. But we can also describe Christ as the \n\nthirteenth man. Death leads to resurrection. \n\nIn a more symbolic sense 13 is unlucky because it takes us beyond \n\n12. 12 is something of a‘perfect’number. It combines the archetypes \n\nof 1 and 2, it symbolizes the zodiac and therefore the universe, it can \n\nbe divided by 1,2, 3, 4, and 6, more digits than any other number. \n\n13 destroys this elegance. It can be divided by nothing but 1 and \n\nitself. Again, we can go beyond the negative aspects of the \n\nsymbolism. Precisely because it ruins the perfection of 12, 13 \n\nsignifies a new creation; death breaks up old forms and makes way \n\nfor the new. \n\nThe number 13 adds up to 4, the Emperor. Through Death we \n\novercome our outer ‘social’ selves. Since 13 is a higher form of 3 the \n\ncard also recalls the Empress, and reminds us again that in nature \n\nlife and death are inseparable. \n\nIn divinatory readings Death signifies a time of change. Often, it \n\nindicates a fear of change. In its most positive aspect it shows a \n\nclearing away of old habits and rigidness to allow a new life to \n\nemerge. In its most negative aspect it indicates a crippling fear of \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n95 \n\nphysical death. This fear goes deeper than many people realize, and \n\noften a reading with many positive indications will end badly \n\nbecause of Death in the position of fears. \n\nThe trump reversed indicates being stuck in old habits. Waite \n\ntalks of, ‘inertia, sleep, lethargy' in life. This sense of a sluggish, \n\nboring life masks the sometimes desperate battle of the ego to avoid \n\nchange. The card always indicates that Death, with its subsequent \n\nrebirth, is not only a possibility but also, in a sense, a necessity. The \n\nmoment has cpme to die. By drowning us in lethargy, the ego \n\nprevents awareness of this fact from coming to consciousness. \n\nInertia, boredom and depression often conceal inner terrors. \n\nTemperance \n\nThe Chariot symbolized the successful construction of an ego able to \n\ndeal victoriously with life. As time goes by this ego becomes rigid; \n\nslowly behaviour becomes less a response to reality and more and \n\nmore a string of habits. The purpose of the second line of the Major \n\nArcana is to free us from this artificial personality, and at the same \n\ntime give us a glimpse of the greater truths within the universe. \n\nTemperance, appearing below the Chariot, shows a person whose \n\nbehaviour is once again connected to the real world but in a way \n\nmore meaningful than ever before. For if the child relates directly to \n\nlife it does so without consciousness, and as consciousness grows so \n\ndoes the ego. Temperance indicates the ability to combine \n\nspontaneity with knowledge. \n\nThe term ‘temperance’ means moderation. For most people this \n\nmeans self control. The Tarot Temperance, however, does not go to \n\nextremes simply because extremes are not necessary. Not an \n\nartificial inhibition according to a moral code, but exactly the \n\nopposite; a true and proper response to all situations as they arise. \n\nThe word ‘temperance’ derives from the Latin ‘temperare’ which \n\nmeans ‘to mix’ or ‘to combine properly’. The person who has \n\nreleased his or her inner self is characterized not only by moderation \n\nbut by an ability to combine the different sides of life. Many people \n\ncan only deal with life by parcelling it off into sections. They create \n\none personality for business and another for their private lives; both \n\nare false. They consider certain moments and situations to be \n\n‘serious’ and others to be ‘fun’ and are careful never to smile at a \n\nserious subject. The people they love are often not the people whom \n\nthey find sexually attractive. All these separations derive from the \n\ninability to take life as it comes, moment by moment. Temperance \n\ncombines the elements of life. In reality it combines the elements of \n\nthe personality, so that the person and the outer world will flow \n\ntogether naturally. \n\n96 SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nThe trump displays the signs of combination all through the \n\npicture. When we look at the Waite-Smith image on the left we see \n\nfirst of all the water being poured from one cup to another; the \n\nelements of life flowing together. Notice that the lower cup is not \n\ndirectly below the upper, so that the picture shows a physical \n\nimpossibility. To other people the Temperate person’s ability to \n\nhandle all life’s problems with joy appears magical. \n\nThe Rider pact Temperance presents both cups as magical. In the \n\nWirth picture on the right the upper one is silver, indicating a flow \n\nfrom the Moon, that is, the unconscious, to the Sun, consciousness. \n\nThe second line began with a withdrawal from the world to find the \n\ninner self; the time has now come to return to the normal activities of \n\nlife. \n\nTURNING INWARDS \n\n97 \n\nThe road especially signifies return. We have gone down into the \n\nself and now we are making our way back to involvement with the \n\nouter world, enriched. Notice that the two pillars of the earlier cards \n\nhave become two mountains. Abstract ideas are becoming reality; \n\nTemperance is a card of behaviour, not concepts. \n\nThe angel stands with one foot on land, one foot in water. As the \n\nwater represents the unconscious so the land symbolizes the ‘real \n\nworld’ of events and the other people. The Temperate personality, \n\nacting frorrt an inner sense of life, links the two realms. The water \n\nalso indicates potentiality, that is, the possibilities of life, while the \n\nland symbolizes manifestation or actuality. The Temperate person, \n\nthrough his or her actions, brings into reality the wonders sensed by \n\nthe Hanged Man. \n\nThe BOTA Temperance (see fig. 15b) shows water being poured \n\non a lion, and a torch dripping flames on an eagle. Leo symbolizes \n\nfire (the Magician), while the eagle, the ‘higher’ form of Scorpio, \n\nstands for water (the High Priestess). The angel is mixing the basic \n\nduality, inseparably combining the different sides of life that \n\npreviously appeared hopelessly alien to each other. Now, the eagle \n\nstands for the higher Scorpio because Scorpio represents the energy \n\nof the unconscious, As the lower form, the scorpion, this energy \n\nshows itself primarily as sexuality, the ‘animal desires’ of the \n\nundeveloped personality. When the energy has been transformed by \n\nchannelling it through awareness it becomes the eagle of spirituality. \n\nStrength showed this energy brought out in the form of the lion; in \n\nthe BOTA Temperance we see the process completed, the eagle and \n\nthe lion combined. \n\nThe angel resembles the Greek goddess Iris, whose sign was the \n\nrainbow; a rainbow appears on the BOTA card and iris flowers on \n\nthe Rider pack version. Rainbows appear as a sign of peace after a \n\nstorm, which reminds us that Temperance shows the personality \n\nreleased by the fearful experience of Death. The rainbow comes \n\nfrom water yet shines as light across the sky, an emblem of the inner \n\nself, which once seemed dark, chaotic, fearful, brought out and \n\njoyously transformed into the promise of new life. In Jewish and \n\nChristian tradition the rainbow is a sign of renewal after the Flood. \n\nThe Flood, like Shiva's destruction of the universe, stands \n\npsychologically for the death of old patterns, which do not reflect the \n\ntruth and joy of life and which lead people into ‘evil’ - behaviour \n\ndestructive to themselves and to others. \n\nAs Zeus’s messenger Iris travelled to the underworld to fill her \n\ngolden cup with water from the River Styx. The Greeks believed \n\nthat dead souls travelled across the Styx to the land of the dead. \n\nOnly a descent into the underworld of the self can renew life* \n\nReligiously the angel symbolizes the immortal soul liberated by \n\n98 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\ndeath. If you look closely below the collar you will see God’s name \n\nworked into the fabric of the gown. In Christian tradition the soul \n\nwill become joined with God after the resurrection. The triangle \n\nwithin the square indicates that the Spirit rises from within the \n\nmaterial body. \n\nPsychologically the angel indicates the energy of life which \n\nemerges after the ego’s Death. The triangle now shows that this \n\nenergy works within the square of ordinary activities. We do not \n\nneed to perform miracles to sense our connection with the immortal \n\nuniverse. We need only be ourselves \n\nRemember that the Tetragrammaton appeared on the W’heel as a \n\nmystery of fate. Here the name has become part of us. We become \n\n‘masters’ of our fate when we learn to deal with life as it comes and \n\nnot according to routines of habits and defences. \n\nThe divinatory meanings, like the card’s ideas, begin with \n\nmoderation, balance in all things and taking the middle path. The \n\ncard means right action, doing the correct thing in whatever \n\nsituation arises. Very often this means doing nothing. The \n\nintemperate person always needs to be doing something, but very \n\noften a situation requires a person to simply wait. The card will \n\nsometimes appear as an antidote to cards of recklessness and \n\nhysteria. \n\nTemperance signifies mixing disparate elements together, \n\nblending activities and feelings to produce a sense of harmony and \n\npeace. Because it means balancing and combining the different sides \n\nof life Temperance carries a special significance for the Minor \n\nArcana. If a reading shows a person split between say, wands and \n\ncups, activity and passivity, or cups and pentacles, fantasy and \n\nreality, then Temperance, moderation and acting from an inner \n\nsense of life, can give a clue to bringing these things together. \n\nLike the Fool reversed Temperance upside down indicates a \n\nwildness, going to extremes. In Temperance this is because the \n\nperson lacks the inner awareness to know what is appropriate to a \n\nsituation. The trump reversed can act as a warning that you have \n\nallowed your life to become fragmented and that you are sliding \n\nfrom one extreme to another. It can in fact indicate failure in the \n\ngreat task of letting old habits and fears die away into the past. On a \n\nsimple level the reversed Temperance tells us to calm down and \n\navoid extremes; in its deepest sense it sends us back to Strength to \n\nbegin that long, sometimes painful, sometimes frightening, but \n\nalways essentially joyous process of death and rebirth. \n\nt",

Even very practised \n\nreaders will often find the alternatives confusing. \n\nAfter the choice of Significator comes the mixing. If the \n\nperson is not asking a particular question I instruct him or her \n\nto empty the mind and concentrate on the hands, or simply on \n\nthe Significator. If the reading does concern a specific question \n\nI ask the person to focus on that and even say the question out \n\nloud to fix it more firmly in the mind. \n\nThe method of shuffling does not matter, except that it must \n\nbe thorough and some of the cards must become turned \n\naround to allow reversed meanings to emerge. One method I \n\nsometimes recommend is to lay the cards on the table or floor \n\n(many readers always do their readings on the silk scarf they \n\nuse to wrap the deck), then with both hands scatter them all \n\naround, like a child playing in the mud. Then I tell the person \n\nto bring the cards back together. Besides its thoroughness this \n\nmethod carries a nice symbolism. Any Tarot reading repre¬ \n\nsents a personal pattern emerging from the chaos of possible \n\ncombinations. Even if we only read ten cards the whole deck \n\nbears the imprint of the person who last mixed them. By scat¬ \n\ntering the deck we return it to chaos; when we bring it back \n\ntogether, it carries the new pattern. \n\nWith the cards mixed the subject must separate them into \n\nthree piles in the following way. Using the left hand he or she \n\nmust remove a pile from the top and place it to the left, then \n\nfrom that pile again remove a pile from the top and lay it down \n\non the left. \n\nNow the reader takes over, and here again people disagree \n\nabout how to put the deck back together. Some simply pick up \n\nthe pile on the right with the left hand, place it over the middle \n\npile and then put these two piles over the pile on the left. \n\nOthers hold their left hand a few inches over each pile until a \n\nwarmth seems to rise from one of them. They then place this \n\npile over the other two. \n\nEither way, when the deck has re-formed, the reader, using \n\nthe right hand, begins to turn over the cards in whatever \n\npattern he or she has decided to follow. Hundreds of patterns \n\nexist. Of the three presented here, one I made up, while the \n\nother two are variations on traditional themes. Almost any \n\nbook on Tarot will give further patterns. \n\n140 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nTHE CELTIC CROSS",

    "text": "THE CELTIC CROSS \n\nOver the years this pattern has proved the most popular. The \n\nCross derives its name from its shape, a cross of equal arms \n\n(one card on each side of the centre), with four cards lined up \n\nas a ‘Staff’ beside it (see Fig. 59, p.147). \n\nAs we might expect, commentators disagree on the meaning \n\nof particular positions and how to describe them. Some, such \n\nas Waite and Eden Gray, provide a sort of ritual for the reader \n\nto pronounce while laying out the cards: ‘This covers him’ or \n\n‘This lies beneath him’. Others prefer more conventional \n\nphraseology. It does not matter which system we use as long \n\nas we remain constant. The meanings described below are the \n\nones I use. I'hey follow the traditional system, with certain \n\nchanges. \n\nTHE SMALL CROSS \n\nIn every way of laying out the Celtic Cross the first two cards \n\nform a small cross of their own with the first one, the ‘cover' \n\ncard, lying directly on top of the Significator and the second \n\nlying horizontally across it. \n\nNow, the cover card usually stands for some basic influence \n\non the subject, a general situation or starting point for the \n\nreading. The second card, which we always read right side up, \n\ndespite how it comes off the deck, represents in traditional \n\nsystems an ‘opposing influence’, something counter to the \n\nfirst. In practice, this ‘opposition’ may actually form a second \n\ninfluence supporting the first. \n\nFor example, suppose the cover card was the Fool, indicat¬ \n\ning a sense of following instincts despite what may seem the \n\nmore sensible practice. If Temperance crossed it, we could call \n\nit an opposition, since Temperance usually refers to caution. \n\nBut if the Knight of Wands crossed the Fool, the two cards \n\nwould tend to support each other, and in fact the other cards \n\nmight suggest a need for a more temperate influence to \n\nbalance all that eagerness. \n\nIn my work I have developed a slightly different way of \n\nlooking at the first two cards, referring to them not as cover \n\nand ‘opposition’ but as ‘Centre’ and ‘crossing’. For their \n\nmeanings I term them the ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ aspects, or some¬ \n\ntimes ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ time, or simply ‘being’ and \n\n‘doing’. The Centre card shows some basic quality of the \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n141 \n\nperson or the person’s situation. I'he crossing card then shows \n\nhow that quality affects the person, or how it translates into \n\naction. Put another way, the first shows what the person is, \n\nthe second how he or she acts. \n\nConsider the example in Fig. 57. The Fool would indicate a \n\nperson with an inner tendency to take chances, to follow \n\ninstinct. Temperance crossing it would mean that when it \n\ncomes to action the person tends towards a more careful \n\napproach, blending instinctive energy with more practical \n\nconsiderations. \n\nFigure 57 \n\nAnother example will help illustrate this most valuable part \n\nof a Celtic Cross reading. The Ace of Cups in the Centre \n\nwould indicate a time of happiness in a person’s life, or more \n\nprecisely a chance of happiness, since the Aces represent \n\nopportunities. If the Ten of Cups crossed the Ace the two \n\nwould imply that the person recognizes the opportunities and \n\nwill use them. But if the Four of Cups should cross the Ace a \n\ndifferent meaning will emerge, showing an apathetic attitude \n\nthat prevents the person appreciating what life offers him or \n\nher. The apathy, however, would not cancel out the oppor¬ \n\ntunity. \n\nI have stressed the small cross because of its importance. In \n\nsome readings the first two cards can tell the whole story, with \n\nthe others filling in details. As described in Fart One the terms \n\n’vertical and horizontal time’ derive from symbolic interpreta- \n\n142 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\ntions of the crucifixion, where Eternity, embodied in Christ as \n\nthe Son of God, intersected the ‘horizontal’ movement of \n\nhistory, that is, the death of one human being. For Christian \n\nmystics the fact of the crucifixion allows them - through \n\nmeditation on the cross and other methods of identification \n\nwith Christ - to bring a sense of ‘vertical’ time into the \n\nhorizontal facts of their own physical existences. In many \n\nother cultures the image of a cross symbolizes the four \n\nhorizontal directions along the surface of the earth, while the \n\ncentre, the meeting place of the four, suggests the essentially \n\nvertical direction of the centre. The cross, therefore, also sym¬ \n\nbolizes the Tarot itself, the four arms being the four suits and \n\nthe centre the Major Arcana. \n\nIn terms of readings, the cross symbolism can show the way \n\nin which a person’s substance, or inner being, can mix with \n\nthe way that person acts in the world. It is worth repeating \n\nhere the original example which suggested the symbolism of \n\ncrossed time. The reading was done for a man unsure of the \n\ndirection of his life. A long love affair was ending, his chosen \n\ncareer as a professional singer had not materialized. The \n\nreading began with the High Priestess crossed by the Hiero¬ \n\nphant. Now these cards, sometimes called the Papess and the \n\nPope, at first glance represent contradictory values. The High \n\nPriestess stands for instinct, mystery, stillness, while the \n\nHierophant, as the preacher of a doctrine by which people \n\nmay guide their lives, stands for orthodoxy, planned \n\nbehaviour, clarity. Therefore, it appeared that the two sym¬ \n\nbolized conflicting approaches to life. The more I looked at \n\nthem, however, with their religious imagery, the more I \n\nthought of conjunctions, rather than opposites. The two \n\nseemed to prescribe almost a way of dealing with life. The \n\nHigh Priestess indicated that within himself this man carried \n\nqualities of instinct and understanding that might never fully \n\nemerge but could give his life substance. The Hierophant, on \n\nthe other hand, showed that in his daily life he needed a more \n\nrational plan of action; he needed to organize and make \n\ndefinite decisions to achieve what he wanted. But these plans \n\nand practical steps would work best if backed by his own \n\ninstincts and inner awareness rather than by socially- \n\nacceptable ideas of proper goals and behaviour. Just as I was \n\ntrying to explain how these qualities could complement each \n\nother the man broke in to say how he saw them as constantly \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n143 \n\nin opposition, how he swung back and forth, giving in first to \n\nhis desires or simply to passivity, and then moving the other \n\nway to very directed orthodox action, such as getting a \n\n‘responsible' middle-class job rather than pursue his singing. \n\nFart of my job in the reading became to show him how these \n\nqualities could work together. \n\n‘BASIS’ \n\nAfter the small cross the reader places the next card directly \n\nbelow the Centre. This position represents the ‘Basis' of the \n\nreading - a situation or event, usually, though not always, in \n\nthe past, which has helped create the current situation. \n\nBecause of the way our past shapes us this card can sometimes \n\nexplain and tie together all the others. In one remarkable \n\nFigure 5S \n\n144 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nreading about a woman’s difficulties relating to her husband, \n\nthe Emperor in the Basis position indicated that her relation¬ \n\nship to her father still dominated her unconscious sexuality \n\nand was preventing her from working out her current \n\nproblems. \n\nUsually the Basis does not show such a broad theme, but \n\noften it does indicate a previous situation, especially if a con¬ \n\nnection exists with the number or suit of one of the first two \n\ncards. Consider these three cards: the Magician crossed by \n\nthe Five of Cups, with the Five of Swords beneath them (see \n\nFig. 58). The Magician, as the person’s being, shows a strong, \n\nhighly-creative and dynamic personality. The Five of Cups, \n\nhowever, indicates that the person is currently preoccupied \n\nwith some loss so that the powerful personality has become \n\nsubdued. In terms of the pictures, the Magician has covered \n\nhis dazzling white and red robe in a black cloak. The Five of \n\nSwords, however, shows that the loss began as a painful and \n\nhumiliating defeat. It is this defeat which has dimmed the \n\nMagician’s fire. But the move from Swords to Cups shows that \n\nalready a process of renewal has begun. The person can begin \n\nto see the situation as one of regret rather than shame. What \n\nmakes this movement possible is the Magician qualities, cur¬ \n\nrently concealed yet still active in the person’s life. \n\n‘RECENT PAST’ \n\nThe next card lies to the left of the small cross and bears the \n\ntitle ‘Recent Past’. The term is really a misnomer, for the \n\ndifference between this position and the Basis lies not so much \n\nin the timescale as in their impact on the person. The Recent \n\nPast refers to events or situations that affect the subject, yet \n\nhave passed or are passing out of importance. Usually it does \n\nrefer to recent events; sometimes, however, it can show some \n\nthing reaching far back or of great importance. In the example \n\nabove, of the woman whose father affected her so strongly, if \n\nthe Emperor had appeared in the Recent Past instead of the \n\nBasis, it would have indicated that the block was receding \n\nfrom her life, and would not affect her so much in the future. \n\n‘POSSIBLE OUTCOME’ \n\nThe next card goes directly above the small cross. Some \n\npeople term this position the ‘Best Possible Outcome’. \n\nHowever, a little practice will demonstrate the narrowness of \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n145 \n\nthis optimistic title. If, say, the Nine of Swords shows up here \n\nit can hardly be called the ‘best' result. Therefore, like many \n\nothers, I refer to this position as simply ‘Possible Outcome'. \n\nNow, since we call the final card ‘Outcome' people may find \n\nthe two terms confusing. By ‘possible’ we mean first of all a \n\nmore general trend that may result from the influences shown \n\nin the reading. At the moment, it remains vague and may \n\nnever actually come about. It simply means the person is \n\nheading in this direction. \n\nSometimes the relationship between the Possible Outcome \n\nand the Outcome includes cause and effect. The Possible may \n\nresult from the Outcome. As a simple example, suppose the \n\nOutcome shows the Eight of Pentacles and the Possible \n\nOutcome shows the Three. The Eight indicates that the \n\nperson will go through a period of hard work and learning. \n\nThe Three indicates that this effort is likely to produce the \n\ndesired result of great skill and success. \n\nSometimes the Possible Outcome indicates a more tentative \n\nresult than the Outcome. Here is an example from a reading \n\ndone several years ago for a woman who had applied for a job \n\nand wanted to know her chances of getting it. The Outcome \n\ncard indicated delays and suspense but the Possible Outcome \n\nshowed success. When the woman went to find out, the hiring \n\nagent told her that they had hired someone else but had put \n\nher on an alternate list. Several days later he called to tell her \n\nthat the someone else had changed her mind and he wanted to \n\nhire the woman. The possible had become real. \n\nThere is another way of comparing the Possible Outcome \n\nand the Outcome, especially if the two contradict each other \n\n(rather than complement, as in the examples above), or if they \n\nshow a direct relationship, such as the same suit or number. \n\nIn these situations I read the Possible Outcome as something \n\nthat might have happened but will not. The task then is to \n\nlook at the other cards for the reason why the outcome should \n\nhappen instead. \n\nSuppose the Star lies in the person’s Possible Outcome, \n\nindicating that the person might emerge feeling very free, full \n\nof hope, open to life. Suppose then that the Devil comes up as \n\nthe actual Outcome, indicating bondage to an oppressive \n\nsituation. What has gone wrong? If, say, the Nine of Swords \n\nreversed lies in the position of Basis, this would give us a clue, \n\nfor it would say that the person holds inside her or him a sense \n\n146 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nof shame and humiliation coming from past weaknesses and \n\nfears, and that the ‘imprisonment’ symbolized in the Nine \n\nprevents the person from realizing the potential of the Star. \n\nThese examples will help us to see that the true meaning of \n\na Tarot reading does not come from specific cards but rather \n\nfrom the configurations they form together. \n\n‘NEAR FUTURE’ \n\nThe final arm of the Cross comes to the right of the central \n\npattern. Lying opposite the Recent Past it bears the title ‘Near \n\nFuture’. It shows some situation that the person will soon have \n\nto face. It does not carry the same totality as the Outcome; \n\nrather it forms yet another influence, in this case the influence \n\nof events. If a situation begins in a certain way but ends very \n\ndifferently, then the reason might lie in the Near Future \n\nbringing in some new situation or person to change the direc¬ \n\ntion. On the other hand, if the Outcome is very different in \n\ncharacter from the Near Future this might indicate that the \n\ncoming situation will have no lasting effect. For example, if the \n\nFive of Wands lies in the Near Future, and the Three of Cups \n\nin the Outcome, it can indicate that the person will go through \n\na period of conflict with friends, but that this conflict will not \n\nlast long, giving way to closer ties, and cooperation. Often \n\nsuch information can greatly help a person come through a \n\ndifficult time by reassuring him or her that it will not last. And \n\nif the opposite should appear (that is, a happy situation will \n\ngive way to a bad one) the reader can simply hope that the \n\nperson can use this information well. Bad news is always less \n\npleasant to give than good. \n\nAfter laying out the Cross the reader turns up the final four \n\ncards, one above the other, to the right of the Cross. The final \n\npattern looks like this: \n\n148 SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\n‘SELF’ \n\nThe card on the bottom of the Staff is called ‘Self’, and refers \n\nnot to the whole person, but to some way in which the person \n\nher or himself is contributing to the situation. What attitudes \n\ndoes the subject show? What is she or he doing that will affect \n\nthe situation described in the other cards? Suppose, in a \n\nreading that began with the Two of Cups, the Self position \n\nshows the Two of Swords. This would indicate that the \n\nsubject finds it difficult to open up to the new relationship \n\nindicated by the first card. The subject’s tense, even hostile \n\nbehaviour greatly affects the overall situation. The Outcome \n\nwould indicate the result of the conflict. \n\n‘ENVIRONMENT’ \n\nJust as the subject affects the reading so also do the people \n\nand general situations around him or her. We call the eighth \n\ncard the 'Environment' or the influence of'Others'. If a court \n\ncard appears in this position it will usually mean a person \n\ninfluencing the subject. Otherwise the card can show either \n\nthe effect of one important person or of a more general situa¬ \n\ntion. Often it will indicate whether the environment is helping \n\nor hindering the direction in which the subject is heading. For \n\ninstance, in a reading done about work, the Five of Wands \n\nreversed in the Environment would suggest that an \n\natmosphere of hostility, trickery, and backstabbing competi¬ \n\ntion is making work unpleasant. \n\nSometimes the Environment indicates the querent rather \n\nthan other people. It shows how the subject reacts to her or his \n\nsurroundings. In a reading done some time ago the Four of \n\nSwords in the Environment showed the person’s habit of \n\nretreating from conflicts with the people around him. \n\n‘HOPES AND FEARS’ \n\nAbove the Environment comes a position similar to Self but \n\none with a sharper focus. We call this position ‘Hopes and \n\nFears’ for it shows how the person's attitudes to the future \n\naffect the working out of events. Often this card will almost \n\ndominate the reading, especially if the Outcome is very diffe¬ \n\nrent from the Possible Outcome, indicating that what seems \n\nlikely will not happen after all. The influence shown by this \n\ncard can work either for or against the person. Suppose the \n\nreading concerns a love affair, and most of the cards tend to \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n149 \n\nsuccess, with the Two of Cups as the Possible Outcome. Yet \n\nthe Outcome shows the Lovers reversed, a clear sign that the \n\nrelationship goes badly. If the Hopes and Fears card was the \n\nThree of Swords it would show that the person’s fear of heart¬ \n\nbreak has prevented the necessary emotional commitment. At \n\nother times, a very positive card in this position, such as the \n\nStar or the Six of Wands (both cards that mean hope), would \n\nindicate that the person’s attitude can create success. \n\nSometimes this position and that of Basis or Self will work \n\nvery closely together, with the Basis explaining the origins of \n\nthe subject’s attitudes to the future. For instance, if the Two of \n\nCups reversed came up as the Hopes and Fears, and Eight of \n\nWands reversed was the Basis, it would indicate that a \n\nbackground of jealousy was leading to a very negative attitude \n\ntowards the continuance of the love affair. \n\nNotice in this last example that the Two of Cups reversed \n\nmight be a fear, but it might also be a hope. We call the \n\nposition Hopes and Fears rather than the more usual Hopes or \n\nFears. The terminology reflects the fact that the two often go \n\ntogether (something originally pointed out to me by my \n\ntherapist student). In work, often people hope for and fear \n\nsuccess at the same time, while in relationships many people \n\nwill fear the love they seek, or will half consciously hope for \n\nrejection. The duality of Hopes and Fears shows up most \n\nstrongly in cards dealing with change, or the emergence from \n\nconfined situations to open ones. \n\nDeath, the Eight of Cups, the Two of Wands reversed, and \n\nthe Four of Wands all deal with these themes of freedom and \n\nchange. Some others are the Devil reversed, the Eight of \n\nSwords reversed, and the Star. Very often if the subject and \n\nthe reader together examine the subject's attitude to one of \n\nthese images in the Hopes and Fears position, an ambivalence \n\nwill emerge. Confinement is more secure than freedom. \n\nBecause the unpleasant component - the fear of love (or \n\nsuccess), or the hope of rejection (or failure) - often remains \n\nhidden from the conscious desires, the discovery of this \n\nambivalence can help the subject work on creating what he or \n\nshe really wants. \n\nSeeing this duality at work in one reading after another \n\nteaches the reader some basic facts about conditioning. The \n\nsubconscious (the repressed material we might call the lower \n\nlayer of the ego - again, see footnote on page 157) is basically \n\n150 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nconservative, even reactionary. It not only resists any change, \n\nwhether desirable or distasteful, it also prefers to deal with all \n\nsituations in the same way it dealt with similar situations in \n\nthe past. For many people each new friend or lover becomes \n\nthe stage for repeating the story of Mummy and Daddy. We \n\nface each new problem or task the way we we learned to deal \n\nwith problems as children. No matter if we dealt with them \n\nsuccessfully; that counts for less than the safety of having a \n\nfixed pattern to follow. The subconscious looks first to security \n\nand then to other considerations. And security comes through \n\nrepetition. \n\nNow, this hidden mechanism of repeating past patterns has \n\nbuilt-in survival value. When new problems arise we can \n\nhandle them because the subconscious automatically \n\ncompares them to previous problems and then clicks into the \n\nready-made response. Unless a person wishes to embark on a \n\ndeliberate programme of self-creation (such as the Major \n\nArcana outlines) this system will work fairly well and \n\nprobably should not be tampered with. However, if a person \n\nfinds one love affair after another collapsing into jealousy and \n\nbitterness, or one job after another failing, then she or he \n\nmight do well to examine the way the subconscious insists on \n\narranging new situations to repeat the past. One way of at \n\nleast beginning such an examination can be Tarot readings, \n\nwith their emphasis on past experience, and what we really \n\nhope for and fear. \n\n‘OUTCOME’ \n\nFinally, the Outcome. This card brings together all the others. \n\nMore, it balances them out and shows which influences are \n\nstrongest, and how they work together to produce the result. \n\nSometimes the Outcome will be an event. Then the important \n\nquestion becomes how it came about, not just what it is. If the \n\nsubject finds it an unpleasant event, then she or he can look at \n\nthe other cards to see what influences are pushing in that \n\ndirection, with the hope of changing the situation. If the \n\nOutcome appears desirable then a similar study can help \n\nincrease those influences, already strong, which are tending \n\ntowards that result. \n\nThe Celtic Cross, like any spread, consists of a fixed \n\nnumber of cards. If the reader and subject find the mixture \n\nambivalent, they can either turn over some more cards \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n151 \n\nwithout a fixed pattern, or else do a further reading. In \n\nturning over extra cards I usually stick to no more than five \n\n(sometimes asking the subject to choose a number), though at \n\ntimes the initial reading has served as the basis for turning \n\nover most of the deck. Usually, beginning readers find it more \n\ndifficult to interpret cards at random and therefore avoid \n\nusing them. \n\nSometimes we may do further readings to get information \n\nabout a specific card in the first reading. We might have a \n\nquestion about a person referred to in the Near Future \n\nposition. In this situation some readers will use the card in \n\nquestion as the Significator for the new reading, just as the \n\noriginal Significator helped the person to concentrate on him \n\nor herself, so the new card helps the person focus on the par¬ \n\nticular question. \n\nA SAMPLE READING \n\nBefore leaving the Celtic Cross I would like to present a \n\nsample reading done by me some months before writing this \n\nbook. (I should state that the subject gave her consent for it to \n\nbe included.) \n\nThe reading was done for a woman who had just passed her \n\nbar exam, who had recently begun a new love affair, and in \n\ngeneral appeared happy and excited about her life. Yet when I \n\nturned over the cards I received an immediate sense of \n\nsadness. Trusting the cards rather than my conscious impres¬ \n\nsions I asked the woman if she had been feeling sad recently. \n\nTo my surprise she immediately said yes. \n\nThe cards came out as follows. For the Significator the \n\nwoman chose the Queen of Pentacles. The first two cards were \n\nthe Three of Wands crossed by the Knight of Cups. The Basis \n\nwas Death, the Recent Past the Nine of Swords, the Possible \n\nOutcome the Five of Swords reversed, and Near Future the \n\nWorld reversed. The Self was the Six of Cups reversed, the \n\nEnvironment the Three of Cups, the Hopes and Fears the \n\nTower, the Hermit the Outcome. (See fig. 60). \n\nI began by giving the woman a general interpretation. She \n\nwas going through a time of transition when many old \n\npatterns were dying out. The effect of this was frightening as \n\nwell as exhilarating. The sadness came from realizing what \n\nshe had lost, and also from the fact that she had grown up and \n\ncut her ties to her childhood. The situation would not resolve \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nOTHOAX 3MX \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n153 \n\nitself very quickly - there was even a chance it would develop \n\nbadly, especially if she let the Near Future, showing stagna¬ \n\ntion, frighten her into a very negative attitude. The people \n\naround her, however, gave her a lot of support, even if \n\nultimately she needed to work it out herself. \n\nAll this, of course, was very general. We then went over the \n\ncards one by one. The cover card, the Three of Wands, \n\nindicated first of all her immediate achievements, not just \n\ngraduating from law school, but even going in the first place. \n\nFor as we discussed what she had done she told me how before \n\nshe had gone to law school she had never taken her life or her \n\nabilities very seriously. Now she had reached a point where \n\nshe not only knew her own strength and intelligence, but the \n\naccomplishment of passing the bar exam on the first attempt \n\nhad given her a solid base from which to look for future work. \n\nEven before we discussed these facts the meaning of them \n\ncame through the image of the man standing on the cliff while \n\nsending his boats out to explore new lands. \n\nBut the Three of Wands carries another meaning, one very \n\nsuited to this reading. It implies a contemplative attitude as a \n\nperson looks over her memories. Actually, this looking over \n\nher life came out of the sense of accomplishment, l he things \n\nshe had done made her aware of how her old life had ended. \n\nAt the same time the boats going out to unknown waters sym¬ \n\nbolized her situation of not really knowing what she would do \n\nnext, or even what shape her life would take in the future. \n\nThe image of accomplishment and exploration bore \n\nreference to other things in the woman's life besides her \n\ncareer. She had recently begun psychotherapy; she had also \n\njoined a support group called ‘the healing circle’. Both of these \n\nactivities increased the sense of newness and the unknown, for \n\nwhile they gave her confidence and belief in herself they also \n\nmade it much more difficult to hold on to past patterns. \n\nNow, the Knight of Cups lay across the Three of Wands \n\nand here the second card appears very much as an outcome of \n\nthe first. For the Knight of Cups signifies an involvement with \n\noneself, with looking inward. The two cards together said that \n\nin the centre of her life the woman at that moment was con¬ \n\ntemplating the past, thinking about what her life had been, \n\nand looking to the future. But the Knight of Cups is the least \n\nconnected to action of any of the Knights. When it came to \n\npractical steps she found herself very hesitant. \n\n154 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nBelow the small cross came Death, the first Major card. \n\nDeath emphasized the experience of seeing the past die away. \n\nAll her life the woman had maintained certain patterns: \n\ncertain ways of dealing with the world, with other people, with \n\nherself. Now, because of her achievements these old ways no \n\nlonger applied. Almost without warning she found herself cut \n\noff from the safe patterns w ithout much idea of how to face the \n\nfuture. More about these patterns became clear as we con¬ \n\nsidered cards of Self and Outcome, but here it was simply \n\nimportant to see that the old, whatever shape it had taken, \n\nhad died. \n\nNotice the resemblance of the Knight of Cups to Death. \n\nSince the trump lies in the Basis - the past - and the Minor \n\ncard in the present, we can call the Knight a practical develop¬ \n\nment from the archetype of Death. That is, underneath she is \n\nexperiencing the loss of her old life, but on the surface she \n\nfinds a lack of confidence, emotional as well as practical, \n\nabout what to do next. \n\nThe Recent Past came directly from the Basis. It shows how \n\nthe two positions can exist almost in the same time frame. In \n\nother words, the Basis did not come first and then give way to \n\nthe Recent Past, but, like the small cross, the Recent Past \n\ncame out of the general pattern shown by the Basis. Now, the \n\nNine of Swords indicates sorrow, grief. It can at times sym¬ \n\nbolize mourning. In this case we can think of ‘mourning' as a \n\nmetaphor. The person she grieves for is herself, for w'e have \n\nseen in the Basis that something has ‘died’. That something \n\nwas not harmful, it had simply lost meaning. However, the \n\nfact that her life had gone beyond it did not stop her from \n\nmissing the safe and comfortable ways of dealing with the \n\nworld. Nor does the card really suggest that she misses her old \n\nself because she fears life. The sadness here is more genuine \n\nand, in fact, coexisted with the equally real joy and excitement \n\nI had seen before the reading. \n\nThe first four cards have stressed her inner life; the next two \n\nshowed the Tarot's ability to indicate trends and events, and \n\nin particular to give a warning. First the Possible Outcome. \n\nThe Five of Swords reversed indicates defeat, producing \n\nshame and humiliation. Its presence here showed that despite \n\nall that the woman had accomplished her efforts might still \n\ncome to nothing. Now, sometimes the Outcome card will \n\nclearly contradict the Possible Outcome, showing that for \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n155 \n\nsome reason the possibility will not become reality. Here the \n\nrelationship is more subtle. The Hermit is a good indicator \n\nthat she will not lose what she has gained, but it does not \n\nguarantee anything. It shows her headed in a good direction, \n\nbut not yet arriving, at least not in the practical sense. \n\nTherefore, the Five of Swords remained a possibility, and the \n\nTarot was warning her to do what she could - use the support \n\nof her friends, not give in to her fears, especially during \n\nperiods of stagnation - to avoid this result. \n\nThe World reversed stands for non-movement, a lack of \n\nsuccess, the inability to put things together. As the Near \n\nFuture it indicated that her life would remain unsettled for \n\nsome time, without much advancement in her career and in \n\nother ways. We see therefore that the defeat of her new self \n\nshown as possible might come when that self fails to achieve \n\npractical results. The fact that the Tarot has warned her of \n\nthis stagnant period could help her get through it, as could \n\nknowing that it is only the Near Future and not the Outcome. \n\nAfter the Cross comes the Staff. The first of the four cards, \n\nthe Six of Cups reversed, lay in the position of Self. And here \n\nwe found a clearer indication of what had died. The card, \n\nwhen right side up, shows a child in a garden with a larger \n\nfigure giving her a gift. It implies protection, security, the \n\nchild whose parents take care of all its needs. Here, however, \n\nwe see the card reversed. Together with the other cards, \n\nespecially Death and the Hermit, the image implied that she \n\nhad overthrown this enclosed, protected way of life. In \n\ndiscussing this card it became clear that in fact the woman \n\nhad spent most of her life with her parents treating her as their \n\n‘little girl’. She had let them do this because of the security it \n\ngave her. Even now, as she explained to me, her parents, \n\nespecially her father, could not accept that she had grown up \n\nand must make her own decisions, take her own chances. And \n\nof course she herself had found the change hard to accept. \n\nGoing to law school had been the first step. Before that she \n\nhad never taken herself seriously enough to do something \n\nimportant. At the same time the school had remained another \n\n‘garden’ - a situation where she did not have to make any \n\nchoices, but just follow the strict pattern laid out for her. \n\nWhen the time came for her to take her exam, she had become \n\nfrightened, and in fact had gone to the therapist to help her \n\npass. The therapy had done this, but it did other things as \n\n156 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nwell. It made her see that she was no longer a child who could \n\nlet other people make her decisions. The sadness came from \n\nthis loss. \n\nThe next card was in some ways the most important, as well \n\nas the simplest in the whole reading. The Three of Cups in the \n\nEnvironment indicated great support from friends. In par¬ \n\nticular it represented the ‘healing circle' and the therapist. Its \n\nimportance lay in the fact that it showed how much uncritical \n\nsupport she could draw from these people, especially impor¬ \n\ntant with the possibility of defeat from a period of stagnancy. \n\nThe Three of Cups does not show support in any sense of \n\ncharity or self-sacrifice. The three women dance together. 'The \n\npeople around her give her strength simply from being with \n\nher, from sharing her experiences and letting her support them. \n\nNotice also the contrast between the Three and the Six. Here \n\nthe women are all equal; the card carries no sense of sheltering \n\nor coddling. \n\nThe Three of Cups bears a ‘horizontal' connection to the \n\nThree of Wands as the Centre. Some of the grounding \n\ninfluences in that image - the figure firmly planted on the \n\nhilltop - derive from the support given in the environment. \n\nEven though looking back on her life, and exploring new \n\nareas, remained essentially lonely activities, she could draw \n\ncourage from the people around her. \n\nIn the position of Hopes and Fears lay one of the more \n\nfearful images in the Tarot, the Tower. It signifies destruction, \n\ncollapse, painful experience. Clearly it represents the woman's \n\nfears that all she has accomplished will somehow fly apart. \n\nThis fear could easily make itself a self-fulfilling prophecy, \n\nleading to the Five of Swords reversed, especially without \n\nimmediate success to reassure and encourage her. \n\nThe exaggerated fear goes back to the Six of Cups, and its \n\noverthrow. She may have given up a sheltered childlike \n\nattitude, she may have been looking on her life with excited \n\nexpectation, yet a part of her still thought, ‘How can I do this? \n\nI’m all alone now. I'm not protected any more. I’ve got to \n\nmake my own decisions.’ And from there it crosses to ‘I can’t \n\ndo this. I’m not strong enough, it’s all going to fall apart.’ \n\nWhen opposition or delay arose, the fe«4r would take over, \n\nmaking it seem like the expected collapse. And the half¬ \n\nconscious thought then becomes ‘See? I knew I couldn’t do it. \n\nWhy did I ever cut myself off?’ In the reading we discussed the \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n157 \n\npossibility that the Tower also represented a subconscious \n\nhope. The subconscious, a very stupid as well as very con¬ \n\nservative organ,* will often refuse to accept the loss of a situa¬ \n\ntion it considered safe or secure. No matter that the self \n\nknows, even consciously, that it can never return to parental \n\nprotection. The subconscious does not accept reality. It can \n\neasily convince itself that defeat of the current plans will bring \n\na return to safety. \n\nTo become aware of such hidden attitudes goes a long way \n\ntowards overcoming them, for the subconscious depends a \n\ngreat deal on concealment. We can see this by thinking of the \n\ntimes we have harboured some secret anxiety, only to find \n\nwhen we say it out loud that the sheer silliness of the idea \n\ndispels it from our mind. A Tarot reading can act in this \n\nfashion by identifying the hidden material and showing its \n\nprobable consequences - in this case, the Five of Swords. \n\nIn the position of Outcome lay the Hermit. The first thing \n\nto observe about this card is that it does not show success or \n\nfailure. In contrast with the Three of Wands and the Five of \n\nSwords it does not indicate likely practical developments. \n\nInstead it points to qualities in the woman herself that in turn \n\nwill show the way she faces her new' situation. \n\nThe most obvious meaning of the Hermit derives from its \n\nname and basic image. It shows her facing life alone. Now, \n\nthis does not mean that she loses or denies the support from \n\nher environment. If anything, it indicates the need to draw on \n\nthat support as much as possible. For the Hermit signifies the \n\n*Do not confuse the ‘subconscious’ with the ‘unconscious', whose \n\nattributes include courage as well as true knowledge. A great deal of \n\nconfusion has resulted from the use of these two terms as synony¬ \n\nmous. I am using the term ‘subconscious’ here to stand for material \n\n- desires, anxieties, fears, hopes - repressed by the conscious mind \n\nas it deals with the outer realities of life. ‘Unconscious' means the \n\nbasic energy of life, that area of being beyond the personal ego. The \n\nsubconscious, despite its hidden qualities, is really an extension of \n\nthe ego. In a sense, it embodies the ego's absolute domain, that \n\nrealm where it makes no compromises with reality. Because it does \n\nnot concern itself with consequences the subsconscious will walk you \n\nin front of a truck to avoid an unpleasant conversation. The uncon¬ \n\nscious, on the other hand, balances and supports us by joining us to \n\nthe great surge of life beyond our individual selves. The Hanged \n\nMan in the Major Arcana gives us a powerful image of this vital con¬ \n\nnection. \n\n158 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nfact that as much as others can help her she alone must make \n\nthe decisions. Like the figure in the Three of Wands the \n\nHermit stands alone on his mountain. \n\nThe Hermit’s aloneness, however, does not exist for its own \n\nsake. In the Major Arcana it symbolizes the act of withdraw¬ \n\ning consciousness from the outer world and events to consider \n\nmeaning. And of course the idea of meaning fits quite well in \n\nthis particular reading. To have the Hermit as the Outcome \n\nmeans that the fears, the delays, and the possible defeats do \n\nnot really matter so much - once the woman accepts her situa¬ \n\ntion. Indeed, the Hermit directly symbolizes psychotherapy. \n\nAt the same time the Hermit also hints towards the success \n\nof her coming to terms with life. For in its most archetypal \n\naspect it signifies wisdom, true knowledge of the soul gained \n\nthrough removal and introspection. The Hermit’s mountain, \n\nlike the Hanged Man’s tree, stands for the conscious mind's \n\nconnection to the wisdom and life energy of the unconscious. \n\nAs the Outcome, therefore, the Hermit indicated that she \n\nwould understand and accept the changes she had made, half \n\nunconsciously, in her life. The mountain symbolism connects \n\nthe last card to the first, the Three of Wands. The connection, \n\nin turn, hints at practical as well as emotional success. \n\nFinally, the Hermit signifies maturity. Through its \n\nawareness it carries on the process begun in the Six of Cups \n\nreversed, the overthrowing of childlike dependency. It shows \n\nher that the situation will resolve itself as the woman over¬ \n\ncomes her hesitancy and fears. In the long run the Hermit 's \n\nmountain stands not for isolation at all, but simply for a \n\nquality the woman was only then beginning to experience - \n\nself-reliance, confidence in her own ability and judgements. \n\nBecause the Outcome showed a working out rather than a \n\nresult, I decided to turn over another card to get an indication \n\nof how events might eventually turn out. The card was \n\nanother three, the Three of Pentacles. As a card of \n\naccomplishment and mastery, it showed the long-term success \n\nthat was delayed in the Near Future.",

    "text": "THE WORK CYCLE \n\nDespite its power, the Celtic Cross stills works mostly as a \n\ndescriptive tool, showing us the different influences surroun¬ \n\nding some situation. Though it often implies a course of action \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n159 \n\n(‘\"lake a careful approach, work at setting everything up \n\nbefore you do anything' or ‘Things won't work out with this \n\nperson. You’ll find your own self again if you let him go.’) \n\nPeople sometimes find themselves left with the question, \n\n‘What should I do?’ While the Tarot does not often give \n\nsuggestions as concrete as ‘Study pottery', or ‘Visit your gran¬ \n\ndmother* it may indicate the sort of action or approach a \n\nperson needs, leaving the specific details to the individual. As \n\na simple example, the Eight of Pentacles can advise a person \n\n‘Keep working at what you are doing. It will take time, but it \n\neventually will bring good results.’ \n\nThere are other, more subtle, questions that people some¬ \n\ntimes ask themselves after a Celtic Cross reading: What if I \n\nfollowed a different set of influences? What if I didn't take this \n\nparticular attitude to the future, or looked to something diffe¬ \n\nrent in my past? How would that change the outcome? In \n\nother words, what are the possible changes I can make? \n\nTo emphasize the possibilities of advice I have devised a \n\nnew layout for the cards. Based partly on the Celtic Cross and \n\npartly on my own arrangement of the Major Arcana, it carries \n\nthree innovations. First, its whole outlook leans towards \n\nadvice rather than description. Second, it is open ended; after \n\nthe reader has reached the last position she or he can lay out \n\nmore cards, up to ten times the original amount. Of course the \n\nreader can do this in any reading, but not in definite positions. \n\nThe structure of the Work Cycle, as I call this spread, allows \n\nthe reader to repeat, and keep repeating, the original posi¬ \n\ntions. The effect is to let the reader look at the situation from \n\ndifferent sides. \n\nThe third innovation involves reading cards in combina¬ \n\ntions. In many readings (though certainly not all; see the Tree \n\nof Life method below) the cards are read individually, even \n\nthough we attempt to combine the meanings, as in the Cross. \n\nIn the Work Cycle, however, the positions include the idea of \n\ncombinations. Readers who know Volume One of this book \n\nwill remember that my interpretation of the Major Arcana \n\ndivides the trumps into the Fool plus three lines of seven cards \n\neach, with each line showing a different stage of development. \n\nThey may also remember that each line breaks down further \n\ninto three parts. The first two cards signify the starting point \n\nfor the line - the archetypes or basic qualities the person must \n\nuse in going through the experiences shown in that line. The \n\n160 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nmiddle three stand for the basic work of the line - what the \n\nperson must assimilate or overcome. The final two cards show \n\nthe result. Thus, in the first line the Magician and the High \n\nPriestess indicate the basic archetypes of life. The Empress, \n\nthe Emperor, and the I lierophant show the different aspects of \n\nthe outer world facing us as we grow up. The Lovers and the \n\nChariot symbolize the development of the successful \n\nindividual. The Work Cycle borrows and adapts this tripartite \n\nstructure. \n\nTHE LAYOUT — POSITIONS AND MEANINGS \n\nThe reading begins w'ith choosing the Significator and mixing \n\nthe cards in the same manner as with the Celtic Cross. \n\nSimilarly, the first two cards from a small cross, interpreted \n\nmuch the same way as in the older method of reading, with \n\nperhaps more emphasis on the crossing card being an \n\noutcome or development of the Centre card. \n\nAfter the small cross the reader turns over seven cards in a \n\nrow below the Significator rather than around it, with the \n\nSignificator and Cross standing above the middle card. (Sec \n\nFig. 61). \n\nThis line forms the basic cycle, and the reading may stop \n\nwith these nine cards. However, if after interpreting this line, \n\nthe reader and subject desire more information or simply \n\nanother approach, the reader turns over a second line of seven \n\ndirectly below the first, and so on, until the meaning becomes \n\nclear. \n\nIn each line the first two cards for the starting point. Their \n\nspecific meanings derive from the Celtic Cross, the first being \n\nPast Experience, interpreted similarly to the Basis card in the \n\nolder form. The second is Expectations, the person's attitude \n\nto the future. In practice, w'e interpret this card in much the \n\nsame way as the Hopes and Fears position of the Celtic Cross. \n\nTogether, the two cards show what has happened and what \n\nthe person hopes, fears, or simply believes will happen. \n\nThe next three cards depart more strongly from the older \n\nsystem. They show what I call the Work - situations, \n\ninfluences, or attitudes the person can use or must overcome. \n\nIn the Cross the positions represent fairly fixed patterns. This \n\nis the way it is. The Work cards indicate possibilities, even \n\nopportunities. It emphasizes how the person creates the situa¬ \n\ntion - and can change it. \n\n162 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nWhen I began this form of reading I assigned a meaning to \n\neach position. The card in the centre indicated Self, the one in \n\nthe left Others, and the one on the right Events. 1 soon found it \n\nbetter to give no specific quality to any of them, but rather to \n\ninterpret them together as simply what the person has to work \n\nwith in the situation, a combination of possibilities. At the \n\nsame time the three designations are worth remembering, for \n\none or more of them may help to pinpoint the meaning in \n\nspecific readings. \n\nLet me give an example of the three as a combination. \n\nSuppose a reading deals with that old favourite, a new \n\nromance. A woman has met someone she likes but does not \n\nknow how he feels about her, or whether she should do \n\nanything about her feelings. The Work section of the reading \n\nshows the Five of Wands, the Hermit reversed, and the Two of \n\nCups (see Fig. 62). \n\nNow, the Two of Cups obviously indicates that the man \n\nfeels about her in a similar way, just as it would in the Celtic \n\nCross. But here the card further advises the woman to tell the \n\nman about her feelings. It also suggests she has much to gain \n\nfrom being with the person, and that the love affair, whether \n\nlong or short, will affect her life quite strongly. \n\nThe Hermit reinforces these ideas. Here its reversed \n\nposition does not mean immaturity, but rather the idea that \n\nnow is not the time for aloneness. Instead, the woman will \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n163 \n\ngain most from being involved in the relationship. The Five of \n\nWands, however, suggests that the situation includes conflict. \n\nBecause it appears right side up, it does not indicate bitterness \n\nor even a serious disturbance that the woman should try to \n\navoid. Instead it shows a quickening quality to their fighting, \n\none that exhilarates rather than drains them. And because it \n\noccurs in the Work section, it implies she should use the energy \n\nreleased through conflict rather than try to avoid it. \n\nThe Hermit coming between the two cards indicates \n\nperhaps that the woman has spent some time cut off from \n\nother people and now wishes (or needs) to return to the world. \n\nOn the one hand she can use her new relationship to bring her \n\nout of herself. On the other hand, she will Find involvement \n\nwith other people brings quarrels and competition, and she \n\nmust learn to accept and use these things. \n\nNotice that the three cards do not simply show what is, but \n\nrather directions and potentials - things to work with. Now let \n\nus consider two possible starting points for this imaginary \n\nreading and the different ways in which they modify the Work \n\ncards. First of all, let us consider the meaning if the first two \n\ncards are the Five of Cups and the Three of Cups, connected \n\nby the image of the three cups. The first, as Past Experience, \n\nindicates the loss of something - most likely the end of a love \n\naffair - and would give the background to the Hermit. \n\nTherefore, Past Experience tells us that the Hermit stage \n\ncame as a reaction to an event, but a reaction the woman can \n\nnow put behind her. The Three reinforces these ideas of new \n\ninvolvement. It shows a very optimistic attitude that will likely \n\ncarry her over the conflicts that arise. \n\nSuppose, however, that we switch the starting point to \n\nSwords, specifically the Eight followed by the Four. The Eight \n\nwould indicate a history of repression, isolation, confusion, \n\nwhile the Four would suggest that this past situation has left \n\nthe woman scarred, for as the Expectation it shows a desire to \n\nhide from the world, to avoid involvement with others. At the \n\nsame time the Four would represent a fear - or belief - that \n\nshe will spend her life alone, with no one breaking into the \n\nclosed church to awaken her and return her to the world. \n\nWith such a starting point the Work cards would indicate \n\nan important opportunity for the person. They would tell her \n\nthat this relationship can bring her out of her lonely Hermit \n\nstate. The time has come to emerge, and if this emergence \n\n164 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nbrings conflicts and arguments she must accept these too, even \n\nuse them to involve herself more strongly in life. \n\nThe last two positions in the line again feature the idea of \n\ncombination. As the Outcome and the Result, they go beyond \n\nthe Celtic Cross’s single use of Outcome to sum up the \n\nreading. The Outcome indicates the likely way things will \n\ndevelop. The Result, on the other hand, indicates the person’s \n\nreaction to this development, or the effect it will have on the \n\nperson’s life. This effect can be either experience or attitude. \n\nFor instance, it can indicate an event or further development \n\nthat comes about because of the Outcome. The Five of Cups \n\nfollowed by the Eight of Cups would say that the person loses \n\nsomething, or something ends badly, and as a result of this, \n\nthe person decides to leave, go somewhere new, or start a new \n\nphase in life. \n\nOr, the Result card can show the Outcome’s effect psy¬ \n\nchologically. A classic example is the Tower followed by the \n\nStar, indicating that an explosion in the person's life would \n\nlead to a release of hope and energy. This example also \n\nillustrates the potential great importance of seeing not just the \n\nOutcome, but what comes afterwards. If a reading showed \n\nonly the Tower, and not the Star as a result of it, it would \n\nleave the subject with a sense of devastation. \n\nVery often the first line will give such a strong picture that \n\nthe person will need no further information. At other times, \n\nhowever, the line may leave the person slightly confused, or \n\nsimply wishing to see the situation from a different point of \n\nview. In this case, the reader may simply turn over another \n\nline directly under the first. The positions remain the same, \n\nand the seven cards still relate to the original small cross that \n\nset out the basic situation. And yet, because we begin with a \n\ndifferent starting point, the line enables us to see the situation \n\nin a different way. \n\nBesides the new information gained, this method helps \n\nanswer a question many people ask about Tarot readings: l If I \n\ndid it again, different cards would appear, so how can these \n\ncards really mean anything? The answer is that the new cards \n\nwill look at the same situation from a new point of view. \n\nVery often, if a reader sets out a Celtic Cross, then mixes the \n\ncards and does it over again, many of the same or similar \n\ncards will appear in the second reading. In one pair of \n\nreadings I did for a married couple (with someone else's \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n165 \n\nreading in between) six out of the ten cards were the same, \n\nand the Environment card in the woman’s reading was the \n\none used as the Significator for the man. The Work Cycle, \n\nbecause it actually prevents the same cards from appearing, \n\ntends more to show different sides to the question. \n\nSometimes the second line will almost mirror the first, \n\nindicating that the situation is heading so strongly in this \n\ndirection that the person will not easily change it. At other \n\ntimes, however, the Outcome-Result will show a definite \n\nalternative to the first line, and then the reader must look to \n\nthe starting points and to the Work cards. \n\nA SAMPLE READING \n\nOnce I did a reading for a woman with a jealous lover. \n\nTheoretically the two did not expect each other to be \n\nmonogamous but the woman knew that if she went with \n\nsomeone else - and someone else had come along - her lover \n\nwould be upset. She wanted advice on what to do and we did a \n\nWork Cycle (see Fig. 63). \n\nBefore the reading I remarked to the woman that the Three \n\nof Cups often appears in such situations, right side up if it is \n\ngoing well, reversed if it is not. The reading began with the \n\nThree of Cups reversed crossed by the Ace of Cups. The com¬ \n\nbination showed that despite the jealousies and arguments the \n\nsituation was giving her a lot of happiness, if only she could \n\nwork it out. The first line then began very positively with the \n\nAce of Pentacles as the Past, and the Sun as a highly \n\noptimistic Expectation for the future. Now, the Ace of \n\nPentacles, besides showing happiness and pleasure, also \n\ncarries a sense of security, of protected and enclosed situa¬ \n\ntions. For some time the woman and her lover had not related \n\nmuch to other people, building up a tight emotional ‘garden’ \n\naround themselves as the Ace symbolism shows (they were, in \n\nfact, living in a remote house in the Welsh countryside). \n\nThe Sun shows the child riding out of a garden. The woman \n\nhoped now to break loose into wider experiences. And, since \n\nthe Ace of Pentacles had changed in the present to the Ace of \n\nCups, at least as a possibility, the cards showed that she had \n\nbegun to let loose, to pour out her emotions regardless of \n\nsecurity. \n\nThe Work seemed even more to suggest freedom. The Star, \n\nthe Tower, and the World, all trumps from the last line, \n\ngano* nV \n\n“WH \n\nJ/U l \n\nFigure 63(a) \n\nA sample work cycle reading \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n167 \n\nshowed first of all the power of the situation. In the centre the \n\nTower symbolized the stormy battles and overpowering \n\nemotions involved. It also suggested the danger of her secure \n\nrelationship being broken down by the lightning bolts of \n\njealousy and resentment. Now, the Star here did not par¬ \n\nticularly indicate a release coming after the l ower, as it would \n\nat the end of the line. Rather, it told her that in this difficult \n\nsituation she needed optimism and extreme openness about \n\nher own desires and emotions. The World also indicated \n\noptimism, implying the possibility of combining the opposing \n\ngoals of a firm relationship and freedom. \n\nAnd yet, despite all these positive influences, the end cards \n\nlooked very unpromising. The Eight of Swords followed by the \n\nDevil implied that she would make an attempt to break loose \n\nfrom the confining qualities of her situation. The Result, \n\nhowever, showed she would probably fail to get free. The \n\nhappy and comfortable security of the Ace of Pentacles had \n\nbecome changed to Devil-like repression, with her and her \n\noriginal lover chained to a situation that neither of them really \n\nwanted. \n\nTo try for another viewpoint - and also to understand what \n\nwent wrong in the first line - we laid down a second row (see \n\nFig. 63(b)). \n\nThis line began more soberly. The Fast Experience showed \n\nthe Seven of Swords, indicating half-hearted attempts to break \n\nout of the confinement in her life. It implied that previously \n\nshe had never seriously pushed the question or faced the real \n\nproblems involved. This card alone hinted at the reasons for \n\nthe Devil asserting itself - the woman had never tried to work \n\nout what had to be done, had never confronted her lover or the \n\nproblems between them. \n\nThe second card carried this idea further. Justice showed \n\nnot just a hope for everyone to be ‘fair’ rather than repressive \n\nor selfish, but even more, a desire to see everything clearly and \n\nface the truth about herself - what she had done with her life, \n\nas well as dealing with the reactions of the others. A harsher, \n\nmuch tougher attitude than the Sun, Justice symbolized a \n\ncommitment to reality, to creating a real future for herself. \n\nNotice that the Sun shows a free child, without responsibilities \n\n- the opposite of Justice. \n\nThe Work in this line - the Nine of Cups, the Four of \n\nPentacles, the Wheel reversed - continued the theme of \n\nFigure 63(b) \n\nA sample work cycle reading continued \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n169 \n\nrealism. The Nine of Cups showed a need to balance the \n\nemotional pressure with light enjoyment. On the other side \n\nthe Wheel reversed indicated being able to sort through all the \n\nillusions involved. It showed as well the need to gain control of \n\nthe situation, to refuse/to allow the Wheel of events to simply \n\nspin her along whichever way it turned. Justice became then \n\nnot just a hope but the primary method of moving away from \n\npassiveness and subjectivity. \n\nOf the three cards in the middle, the Four of Pentacles \n\nproved the most interesting, especially compared with the \n\nTower above it. Where the trump had shown her Hying apart \n\nunder the impact of everyone’s charged emotions the Four of \n\nPentacles showed her protecting herself. It showed her \n\nholding on to her own needs, her own understanding of the \n\nsituation, despite the pressure on her from her two lovers. The \n\ntwo cards around it indicated ways to do this; first by enjoying \n\nherself and using that pleasure to hold herself together; and \n\nsecond by understanding what had happened and why it had \n\nhappened. The Wheel reversed on the right indicated the need \n\n- and the opportunity - actually to apply her hope for Justice, \n\nthat is, to work hard at understanding the true meaning of all \n\nthe changes going on in her life. \n\nIn discussing these two lines the woman said that the first \n\nlooked to her like what she should want, and the second what \n\nshe really wanted. People around her talked so much of \n\n‘freedom’ and open relationships without painful conse¬ \n\nquences that she felt pressured to want this ‘Sun’ kind of \n\nbehaviour. In reality she cared much more for Justice, the \n\ntruth. The result of the second line’s harsher, more realistic \n\nstarting point showed the sense of what she said. The \n\nOutcome card was the Queen of Wands, with the Six of \n\nWands as the Result. The Queen indicated that by looking \n\nfirst to Justice rather than an overly optimistic Sun, the \n\nwoman would find a sense of her own strength and joy. She \n\nwould become more dependent on herself rather than the \n\noutside situation. From this would come the confidence and \n\nbelief of the Six, an optimism which would carry the other \n\npeople along with her.",

    "text": "THE STRUCTURE OF THE TREE \n\nBefore going through these meanings, we should look briefly \n\nat the Tree’s structure. There are two basic patterns within \n\nthe Tree, shown as follows: \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n171 \n\nDiagram (a) emphasizes levels of awareness. The top \n\ntriangle remains closest to God, from whom the original point \n\nof light emanated to create the Hrst Sephirah. As the light of \n\ncreation travelled through the different triangles it became \n\nmore and more diluted, or even for some people corrupted, \n\nuntil in the last, single, Sephirah it became contained within \n\nthe physical world of fiesh and rock and water. (Such a brief \n\ndescription of course greatly distorts Qabalist philosophy. I \n\ngive it here only to show something of the background for the \n\nTree of Life reading.) \n\nThe concept of a downward descent of the light is used in \n\ndivination in the following way. Since we wish to describe a \n\nperson’s life we look at each triangle as an aspect of that \n\nperson, using a tripartite system similar to the three lines of \n\nthe Major. Arcana. The top triangle signifies a person’s \n\nspiritual existence, pointing upwards to the subject's highest \n\npotential. The middle triangle pointing downwards to \n\nmanifestation, represents the ways in which the person deals \n\nwith the outer world, the practical matters of life. The bottom \n\ntriangle again points downwards but this time into the \n\nhidden areas of the self. It stands for unconscious drives and \n\nimaginative energy. We can also refer to the triangles as \n\nsuper-conscious, conscious- and unconscious. \n\nThe bottom position, standing apart, represents not a \n\npersonal quality as do the others, but the outer world in which \n\nthe person lives. We can think of it as similar to Environment \n\nin the Celtic Cross, but on a much wider level. \n\nDiagram (b) derives from the idea of polarity or opposing \n\nforces. In Qabalah the right and left sides of the Tree signify \n\nthe way in which God directs existence. The right pillar, that \n\n172 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nof Grace, tends towards expansion. Its qualities enlarge and \n\nopen out. The left pillar, called Severity, contracts, emphasiz¬ \n\ning qualities that restrict. The one gives, the other takes away, \n\nthereby maintaining the conservation of energy. But if only \n\nthose two forces existed the universe would swing wildly back \n\nand forth, constantly expanding and contracting. Therefore, \n\nthe middle pillar stands for Reconciliation, a blending and \n\nharmonizing of the two principles. Notice that the last \n\nSephirah, symbolizing physical existence, falls in the middle \n\npillar. In the material world the archetypal elements merge \n\ninto a stable form. \n\nThe image of the three columns appears in less abstract \n\nform in the Rider pack version (as well as a number of others) \n\nof the High Priestess. The dark pillar stands for Severity, the \n\nlight pillar for Grace. The High Priestess herself fulfils the \n\nfunction of Reconciliation, balancing the yin and yang \n\nopposites within perfect stillness. \n\nJust as we need a ‘practical' version of the triangles, so our \n\npurpose requires a more diredt interpretation of the three \n\npillars. We therefore use a recurring pattern for each triangle. \n\nThe position on the left tends towards the problems arising \n\nfrom that level, the one on the right depicts the benefits or \n\npositive direction. The position in the middle describes the \n\nquality itself, where the oppositions are blended together. \n\nThese distinctions will become clearer when we look at the \n\nindividual Sephiroth. \n\nOne further point about the structure. Qabalists picture the \n\npath made by the light of creation as a zigzag, sometimes \n\nreferred to as the lightning bolt of God. Beginning beyond the \n\nfirst Sephirah (for God’s true essence remains unknowable \n\nand transcendent) it runs like this: \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n173 \n\nIn meditation we use this image primarily to help us \n\nadvance through the Sephiroth towards union with that \n\naspect of God we experience in mystic ecstasy. In other words, \n\nthrough meditative discipline we travel backwards along the \n\nlightning bolt, as if we were unravelling the universe to get to \n\nits source. The lightning striking the Tower in the Major \n\nArcana symbolizes this light of illumination. \n\nAnother form of meditation, mixed with ceremonial magic, \n\nattempts to follow the lightning downwards, or rather to call it \n\ndown upon the person. Called ‘Practical Qabalah', this use of \n\nQabalistic principles for magic bases much of its work on the \n\nidea that proper ritual and meditation can bring a lightning \n\nflash, not just of understanding, but of great power onto the \n\nmagician. The person following these occult practices is \n\nwarned not to seek this power for personal gain but only for \n\nprojects serving the community. (The warnings against \n\nmisuse given in magical grimoires sometimes strike one as \n\nsimilar to the warnings on pornographic books: ‘This material \n\nis for medical use only’.) \n\nTHE LAYOUT",

    "text": "THE LAYOUT \n\nIn divination we follow the lightning pattern in a much more \n\nmundane way, as the method of laying out the cards. To do a \n\nTree of Life reading the reader first removes the Significator as \n\nin the other methods, and places it high on the reading surface \n\n(obviously a lot of room is needed to lay out seventy-eight \n\ncards). When the subject has shuffled and cut the deck, the \n\nreader takes the cards and begins laying them face down \n\naccording to the pattern: \n\n1 \n\n3 2 \n\n5 4 \n\n6 \n\n8 \n\n7 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n174 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nThe Significator remains exposed above the reading. When \n\nthe first ten cards are placed the reader lays down another ten \n\non top of them, and so on, until each place contains a pack of \n\nseven cards. Now, removing the Significator from the deck \n\nleaves seventy-seven cards, or eleven times seven. Therefore, \n\nthe reader will end up with seven extra cards. Many Qabalists \n\nspeak of an ‘invisible' eleventh Sephirah, known as Daath, or \n\nKnowledge. Usually Qabalists will place this extra Sephirah \n\nin the middle pillar, between the first and sixth Sephiroth, \n\nthat is, between the top and middle triangles. In Tarot \n\nreadings we place it to the side or on the bottom, and read it \n\nafter ail the others. The fact that we do not place it down in \n\norder with the other cards but simply use the ‘left over' seven \n\ncards emphasizes its uniqueness. The Daath pack does not \n\nbelong in any of the general areas of influence. Some readers \n\nsee it as signifying the immediate future. \n\nWhen I first began doing the Tree of Life readings I used \n\nthe Daath pack as a general commentary, an extra bit of infor¬ \n\nmation applying to the reading as a whole. 1 have since found \n\na more specific meaning for it, that of Transformation. \n\nIn Volume One I described the idea, derived both from \n\nQabalah and modern quantum mechanics, that any change \n\ncomes not as gradual alteration, but as a jump from one state \n\nto another. We may lead up to changes with years of gradual \n\npreparation but the actual change occurs as a leap across an \n\nabyss. We cease being one thing and become another. In these \n\nmoments of transformation we can sometimes sense the essen¬ \n\ntial Nothing underlying all fixed existence. Some people \n\ndescribe Daath as the aspect which sense this truth of the \n\nabyss. Others point out that Daath links Wisdom (Sephirah \n\n2) and Understanding (Sephirah 3) through its qualities of \n\nawareness and reflection. Indeeed, ‘Daath’ means ‘Know¬ \n\nledge’. \n\nWith these meanings in mind I found it worthwhile to use \n\nthe Daath pack as a description of the means by which a \n\nperson changes. Related to the whole reading it emphasizes \n\nthe connections a person makes betweep the different levels. \n\nThe different Sephiroth/positions tend po show distinct levels \n\nand conditions of being. The Daath pack helps us see how we \n\nmove between them. Therefore, the name I have given it is \n\nTransformation. \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n175",

Usually related to \n\nthe Crown line it emphasizes the process of development \n\nrather than the result. For example, if the Sun appears in the \n\nCrown line we would interpret it as joy and freedom, \n\nappreciated for themselves. If it appeared in Creative Intelli¬ \n\ngence we would think of those qualities as the means towards \n\nwhatever we had seen in the Crown.

For example, suppose the Nine of Wands appeared \n\nin Hokmah. The reader would first emphasize the strength \n\nand determination rather than the rigidity inherent in the \n\ncard. But suppose the Four of Wands appeared in the line as \n\nwell.

Using the \n\nTarot to diagnose specific physical problems can be a very \n\ntricky operation, though suggestions for doing this exist, \n\nusually linking the cards to astrological aspects or other \n\nsystems. I have found it better to get a more general picture \n\nfrom the line, looking not just at physical condition but also \n\nemotional, spiritual health. \n\nOne recommendation - observe which elements dominate. \n\nStrong Wands suggest good general health through the \n\nperson’s life, though of course such Wands as the Ten or tfie \n\nNine, as well as reversed Wands, might indicate the opposite. \n\nCups and Swords tend to show the emotional and spiritual \n\ncondition of the person, while Pentacles often show weaker \n\nhealth or the need to take care of the body. The Five, for \n\ninstance, would be a definite warning. A predominance of \n\nMajor cards in the line is more difficult to interpret, depen¬ \n\nding for meaning on which cards appear. Strength, of course, \n\nwould indicate good general health, Temperance would \n\nindicate illness averted by caution, while the Devil might show- \n\nsickness, or hypochondria. Sometimes a single Major card can \n\nsymbolize some special situation that has appeared or will \n\nappear in the person’s life. Time sequences in this line, and in \n\nthe whole tree, remain a difficult problem, especially for the \n\nbeginning reader. \n\nThe third triangle deals with the Unconscious, particularly \n\nthe imaginative and sexual drives. In Volume One we looked \n\nat the idea that super-consciousness, or spiritual energy and \n\nawareness, consists of the unconscious transformed and made \n\nconscious. Thus, the Tree will often show very strong connec¬ \n\ntions between the top and bottom triangles, with the middle \n\nlevel - the person’s conscious experiences - forming a link \n\nbetween the two. \n\nEarlier 1 described the subconscious as the repressed side of \n\nthe ego, distinct from the unconscious, or life energy of the \n\nperson. None of these triangles deals specifically with this \n\nsense of the subconscious. Rather, this hidden material can \n\n178 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nappear throughout the reading, showing problems, aggres¬ \n\nsion, or unfulfilled desires. Unfortunately the vast ness of this \n\nsubject prevents me giving detailed examples. (1 apologize for \n\nindulging in something resembling the dark hints one often \n\nfinds in occult books: ‘Here 1 may say no more about this.’) I \n\nwill only point out that we can see the subconscious at work in \n\nthe seeming contradictions of, say, the Two of Swords appear¬ \n\ning as a block in the line of Creative Force. \n\n7 Netzach or Eternity",

If \n\nthe cards show satisfaction and freedom, then certainly we \n\nshould interpret them that way. \n\n9 Yesod or Foundation",

It \n\nremains both the source and the driving force of the per¬ \n\nsonality.

    "text": "10 Malkuth or Kingdom \n\nBelow Imagination comes Malkuth. or Kingdom, meaning the \n\nWorld around the person. Here we see the external influences, \n\nother people, situations both personal and social/political. \n\nUsually, of course, indications of these outside forces will \n\nappear throughout the reading. In one reading the Emperor, \n\nas the woman’s domineering husband, appeared in the centre \n\nof her Health line, that is, in the exact centre of the Tree. \n\nHowever, the last line emphasizes outer influences, showing \n\nalso the effect upon the subject. We can look at it as similar to \n\nthe Environment of the Cross, but greatly expanded. \n\nDaath \n\nFinally we come to Daath. Though we set it aside from the \n\nTree when dealing out the cards, many readers will want to \n\nlay it out below Malkuth, thereby producing a symmetrical \n\nTree as well as graphically showing how connections underlie \n\nall positions. \n\nSometimes these cards will clearly refer to one particular \n\nsituation shown above in one of the three triangles. Usually, \n\nwe do not give the Daath cards a specific function as we do \n\nwith the other lines. Like the Fool in the Major Arcana, it \n\nmoves between all of them, joining things together, helping \n\nthe general pattern become clearer in the reader's and sub¬ \n\nject’s minds. \n\nThe image of the entire Tree, seventy-eight brightly \n\ncoloured cards, can be an astounding sight. I have sometimes \n\ntaken photographs of it for myself and for the subject. I would \n\nrecommend readers to make a chart of the Tree, marking the \n\npositions and the individual cards. Vlost people also find it \n\nvaluable to make a cassette recording which they can play \n\nback later to help assimilate the tremendous amount of infor¬ \n\nmation. \n\nIf the reader and the subject have begun a regular \n\nprogramme of readings, then a Tree of Life, written and \n\nrecorded, can help make the readings more effective. Often it \n\nworks best not to do the Tree immediately, but rather to do \n\none or two small readings first to get an idea of the issues in \n\nTYPES OF READINGS \n\n181 \n\nthe person’s life. A Tree of Life will then provide a comprehen¬ \n\nsive view of the subject, which both people can use as a \n\nreference in later readings. \n\nTo do such a reading requires a great knowledge of the \n\ncards and of the ways in which they mesh together. \n\nRemember that the astrologer doing a natal chart is usually \n\nable to construct the chart ahead of time and consider its \n\nvarious qualities before having to explain it to the subject. But \n\na Tree of Life reading, like any Tarot reading, works best \n\nwhen we interpret the cards as we lay them out. \n\nRemember also that each line contains seven cards. Each \n\nline is itself a reading. Sometimes the seven cards appear as a \n\ngroup of individual experiences. More often, a pattern will \n\nform within the line. Our understanding of it may move from, \n\nsay, left to right almost like a story; or we might focus on the \n\ncentre card as a dominant theme, with the surrounding cards \n\ninterpreted partly according to their positions. I have often \n\nfound symmetry an important clue - cards one and seven \n\nrelating to each other, two and six, etc. Or. the three cards on \n\nthe right may show one characteristic, while the ones on the \n\nleft some other, possibly contradictory one. Each line carries \n\nits own movement, its own perfection.",

    "text": "Chapter 7 \n\nHow to Use Tarot Readings \n\nThe value of a Tarot reading, at least for the subject, depends \n\non what he or she does with it afterwards. For those people \n\nwho come to a reader out of curiosity or as a game the reading \n\nwill probably pass by their lives, like a show they watch from \n\nthe audience. But this show concerns them, and if the reading \n\nmeans anything real, they will want to put it to some practical \n\nuse. \n\nFirst of all, the reader and the subject cannot use the \n\nreading at all until they understand it. Therefore the reader \n\nmust develop skills of interpretation, and the best way to do \n\nthis is to practise. When you begin do not assume a great \n\ndepth of knowledge; just keep at it. Do not worry if you cannot \n\nsee how things fit together, or become confused by all the \n\npossible interpretations of some single card. After a while you \n\nwill find that you notice things that would have slid past you \n\nwhen you first began. \n\nStudy. Learn the meanings described in whatever books \n\nstrike you as valuable. Then begin the process of making your \n\nown book. Get a good notebook and record your descriptions, \n\nfeelings, and experiences for each card. You can do this in \n\nwords, pictures, diagrams, whatever method means some¬ \n\nthing to you. In the same or another book record the readings \n\nyou do and what you have learned froirnhem. If some reading \n\nteaches you a new point about some sjtigle card or combina¬ \n\ntion or the whole deck, record this as well. \n\nDo not take for granted that you know what you have \n\nalready learned. We all carry certain biases and as time goes \n\nby we tend to remember some meanings and forget others. \n\nOften a card will make no sense because we insist on \n\ninterpreting it in a certain way strictly from habit, when \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n183 \n\nanother, forgotten meaning will clear it immediately. \n\nTherefore, from time to time, even after you think you know \n\nall the cards by heart, look back on your notes and your books. \n\nYou will be surprised at how much you relearn. \n\nKeeping a notebook serves another purpose. As described \n\nabove Tarot readings help teach us a balance between intui¬ \n\ntion and action, the High Priestess and the Magician. A \n\nnotebook is one practical way to develop this balance, for it \n\ncombines your own impressions with the ideas you have \n\nlearned from published texts. Making your own book is \n\nespecially important if you are the sort of person who believes \n\nwhat you learn from a published book or a teacher. You are \n\nthe reader, and in any situation the cards lie before you and no \n\none else. Without the ability to respond instinctively to the \n\npictures you will never be able to choose between the possible \n\ninterpretations, let alone find a new meaning just right for that \n\nreading. \n\nWe all possess the ability to respond intuitively, but like any \n\nother faculty, this kind of perception requires training and \n\ndevelopment. A notebook will help here too. Besides giving \n\nyou something permanent to look at later, the very act of \n\nwriting them down will give your ideas more substance. You \n\nwill also find the original ideas will be greatly extended as new \n\npoints occur to you while you write them down. \n\nYou can also train the intuition by spending time with the \n\npictures, looking at them, mixing them, telling stories with \n\nthem, above all, forgetting what they are supposed to mean. \n\nForget the symbolism as you pay attention to the colours, the \n\nshapes, the very feel and weight of the cards. \n\nAs the reader becomes more competent the readings will \n\nbecome more valuable. The primary thing we get from any \n\nreading is information, but the information can be of different \n\nkinds. For people with an awareness of the spiritual undercur¬ \n\nrents shaping all our lives the Tarot can show what particular \n\nshape these currents are taking at that moment. For others, \n\nreadings may show the likely developments from some par¬ \n\nticular situation or decision. Look for a new job, start a love \n\naffair, continue writing a novel - these are all mundane issues, \n\nseemingly far from the mystic concerns of the Major Arcana. \n\nNevertheless, these are the things most people look at in Tarot \n\nreadings; and in fact they are also the ways in which we truly \n\ndevelop, because they are the ways w'e involve ourselves in life. \n\n184 SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nThey form the reality rising out of the spiritual undercurrents. \n\nA Tarot reading can help us examine the consequences of \n\nsuch actions and decisions. \n\nTarot readings, then, can give us information. But to act on \n\nthat information, especially if it goes against our desires, \n\nremains very difficult. \n\nWe can think up endless dodges to deny the validity of \n\nTarot readings. On one level we tell ourselves, 1 It’s only a pack \n\nof cards.’ But even those who do not dismiss the Tarot’s pre¬ \n\ndictions so easily may think, ‘Now that I know what it says I \n\ncan make sure it won’t work out that way.’ Around the time I \n\nfirst began to use Tarot cards I consulted them on something I \n\nwanted to do but recognized was dangerous. The cards \n\nindicated disaster and spelled out quite clear the shape that \n\ndisaster would take. I then said to myself, ‘Well, now that I’ve \n\nseen the dangers I can make sure I avoid them.’ I went ahead \n\nwith what I wanted to do, and the situation worked out, in \n\ndetail, the way the cards had predicted. Not having learned \n\nmy lesson I read the cards again, hoping not for the truth, but \n\nfor some reassuring message. I was using a book of meanings \n\nat that time, and when I looked up the Basis card the book \n\ngave as an interpretation, ‘Failure to follow' good advice’. \n\nThe problem with making a decision based on a Tarot \n\nreading is that we never know how it would have turned out \n\notherwise. Suppose a student considers leaving college and the \n\ncards advise strongly against it. If she follows the reading she \n\nwill never know w'hat might have happened if she had followed \n\nher desire instead. Of course the whole point of the reading is \n\nthat it does tell her what would have happened. But, she will \n\nalways wonder, suppose it was not true? A prediction, \n\nespecially from a pack of cards, can never carry the same \n\nimpact as actual experience. Curiosity alone can make us do \n\ndisastrous things. \n\nIt takes courage to overcome curiosity and desire. Some \n\nyears ago I read that the poet Allen Ginsberg and a woman \n\nlover of his were thinking of having a baby together. They did \n\na reading, with the Tarot or the I Ching, I forget which, and \n\ngot a negative prediction. They gave up the idea. I do not \n\nknow how much they really wanted a child, but 1 remember \n\nadmiring their strength in resisting the desire. I once did not \n\ngo to a potentially valuable conference because the cards \n\nshowed me unpleasant consequences. 1 was able to recognize \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n183 \n\nthe truth of what the cards indicated, at least in regard to \n\nwhat 1 would have contributed to the situation. Even so, I \n\nfound it difficult not to ignore the information and go ahead. \n\nWe can think up some truly marvellous excuses for avoiding \n\nthe obvious truth of a reading. If we respect the cards too \n\nmuch to simply declare them nonsense, we will often look for \n\ncertain ‘false' images to discredit the whole reading. Does the \n\nOutcome card not seem to fit the situation? Rather than \n\ninterpret it in the light of the others, we will write off the whole \n\nreading. \n\nSome books advise readers never to read for themselves \n\nbecause of the lack of objectivity. For a long time I went to a \n\nfriend for readings and she to me, because neither of us trusted \n\nourselves to interpret our own cards honestly. When I started \n\ndoing my own readings I still found it hard to overcome \n\nvarious mental tricks to avoid unpleasant images. My \n\nfavourite worked as follows: I could not ignore the cards I did \n\nnot like or simply declare them untrue or exaggerated. That \n\nwould have seemed too obvious. Therefore I looked in the \n\nreading for some very positive image, such as the Ace of Cups, \n\nand said to myself, ‘Well, that can't be true, nothing so good \n\ncould come out of this mess.’ And then I would dismiss the \n\nwhole reading on the grounds that if this one card made no \n\nsense none of the others did. Another trick I discovered myself \n\ndoing was to lay out the cards very casually, so if something \n\nbad came up I could think, ‘Well, I didn't really mean it, I \n\ndidn’t do it seriously.' I could only read for myself when I \n\nbegan treating the readings in the same way I would anyone \n\nelse’s, mixing the cards carefully, working at the images, \n\ntrying to get some direction for action (or inaction). \n\nA reading will not always give a clear yes or no answer to a \n\nquestion. It may show simply a complex of trends and \n\ninfluences. Sometimes the reading does not involve a choice \n\nbecause of an ongoing situation which cannot easily be \n\navoided. Then specific images and meanings become very \n\nimportant. The Tarot can help us pinpoint the important \n\nelements in the situation, the ones that need the most work to \n\nchange, or bring about, the predicted outcome. \n\nPeople may use the idea, ‘Now that I know what it says, I \n\ncan do something about it ’ as an excuse to follow their desires. \n\nNevertheless, the statement remains true. Maybe we have a \n\nvery pessimistic attitude or an exaggerated fear, or an \n\n186 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nunreasonable hope. To recognize such things helps us gain a \n\nclearer perspective. Maybe our past experience governs our \n\nbehaviour or confuses what we expect from the future. \n\nKnowing this consciously can put us on the way to overcom¬ \n\ning it. Or maybe the cards will show us someone else’s \n\njealousy or vindictiveness; we can then take steps to free our¬ \n\nselves from that person's influence. Or, if the cards show love \n\nand support from someone, w’e know' we can trust that person. \n\nAll these things require some sort of response to make them \n\nreal. We cannot expect to make use of a person’s friendship if \n\nwe do not make ourselves open to it. Wherever possible the \n\nreader should try to point out to the subject definite steps \n\nw'hich can be taken to make best use of the information. If the \n\nreader cannot recommend a concrete course of action then he \n\nor she should point out what area the subject needs to work \n\non. \n\nAbove all, the reader must learn to form a coherent pattern \n\nfrom the reading. Often, beginning readers will learn the \n\ncards and advance to the point where they can skilfully \n\ninterpret each image in its specific position. At the end the \n\nsubject finds him or herself with a jumble of different points \n\nand no clear idea of how' it all fits together. A good reader can \n\nsum up what the reading says in a few sentences. Usually I \n\nwill try to do this at both the beginning and end of the \n\nreading, impressing on the subject’s mind the most important \n\npoints. Does the Environment support or hinder? Do the \n\nperson’s Expectations help or hurt? Will the Outcome bring a \n\nvaluable Result? The subject needs these questions answered, \n\nnot just in all their complexity, but also in as simple a way as \n\npossible. And how does one thing come out of another? How \n\ndoes the past help form the future? What does the person con¬ \n\ntribute to the overall situation? \n\nAlong with coherency comes the need for a positive \n\napproach. It is not enough to depict things as they are. The \n\nperson wants to know what to do, what not to do. If the cards \n\nshow something good, the subject still needs to know how to \n\nhelp this along. And if they show' disaster the reader must say \n\nso, but can also say what, if anything, the person can do. \n\nWhat brings about this unpleasant Outcome? Can these \n\ninfluences be altered or avoided? How can the person coun¬ \n\nteract, or at least cushion it? What elements show other \n\npossibilities? Can we look for anything good to come out of it? \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n187 \n\nIf the Outcome arises from some particular course of action, \n\nshould the person abandon it? When we do a Tarot reading \n\nfor someone we take on the responsibility of trying to send that \n\nperson in a positive direction. \n\nBeyond specific suggestions of do this rather than that, lies \n\na wider area of possible action derived from the ways the suits \n\nbalance each other. In the introduction to each suit we con¬ \n\nsidered its problems and the way we could ‘add’ other suits/ \n\nelements. In practice, this adding is often difficult to achieve, \n\nbecause it means breaking the pattern shown in the reading \n\nitself. For this very reason, however, it is worth trying in situa¬ \n\ntions where the reading shows a dead end if the person stays \n\nwith the elements given. \n\nThe most direct way to bring in an outside influence \n\ninvolves simple suggestions. If the reading indicates a need for \n\nthe grounding influence of Pentacles, the subject can try doing \n\nmore physical things, such as sports or gardening, or paying \n\nmore attention to more mundane activities, such as work or \n\nstudy or keeping busy around the house. If the reading shows \n\na need for the watery qualities of Cups, then the reader may \n\nemphasize the person’s dreams and fantasies, and may \n\nsuggest activities such as meditation or drawing. A person can \n\nfill a need for Wands by becoming more active physically, \n\ncompeting with other people, or starting new projects. And a \n\nneed for Swords would call for a sober, carefully thought out \n\napproach to the person’s situation. The important thing about \n\nthese recommendations is that they reach beyond the reading. \n\nThey deal with the cards that do not appear as well as the \n\nones that do. Therefore, beginning readers should use this \n\nmethod carefully, lest they assume too much knowledge and \n\ncontrol on their part. \n\nMEDITATION \n\nSo far, we have considered practical responses to the informa¬ \n\ntion gained from a reading. But a Tarot reading is not the \n\nwords describing it; it is rather a series of pictures. And the \n\nmost direct response to a reading depends on working with the \n\npictures themselves. For people who know the cards well, or \n\nfor people with some experience in meditation, it becomes \n\npossible to work directly with the images to help bring about \n\nthe effects associated with that card. There is nothing vague or \n\n188 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nmysterious about this process. It requires concentration as \n\nwell as instinctive feeling, and it does not replace practical \n\nsteps. On the contrary, it helps to make those steps more \n\naccessible. For if the card Strength appears in a reading as \n\nsomething we need in our life, why not let the card itself help \n\ngive it to us? \n\nBesides actual meditation I often recommend to people that \n\nthey carry a certain card around with them, and try to remain \n\nconscious of it being there, taking it out from time to time, \n\nlooking at it, thinking about what it means. The constant \n\nawareness helps keep the entire reading in focus as well. \n\nMeditation can also help to bring in new influences from \n\noutside the reading. Suppose the Star does not appear in the \n\nreading, but as the reader we think it should. In other words, \n\nthe archetype of the Star seems to us to symbolize exactly \n\nthose qualities the person needs. Now, we can show the person \n\nthe card and discuss the ideas associated with it. It is more \n\nvaluable, however, to give the person an actual experience of \n\nthe card. \n\nBriefly, the method works as follows. We begin by leading \n\nthe person into a meditative state; help him or her to relax, to \n\nbreathe deeply, to release all the thoughts and tensions clut¬ \n\ntering up consciousness. When the subject has reached this \n\nlevel (and with a little experience we can sense this), we then \n\nbegin to give suggestions leading into the card. T he sugges¬ \n\ntions may be a description of the card to set the scene (with \n\nthe Empress, for example, ‘You are in a garden full of flowers, \n\nwith a river running alongside it. There is a woman lying on a \n\ncouch ...') or more simply, basic images such as sun, water, \n\nwind, that belong to the card’s archetypal qualities. \n\nUsually it is best to keep these opening suggestions as \n\nsimple as possible. If we describe the card we should not try to \n\ninclude all the details. Let the subject create the actual \n\nimpressions. We function only as a guide to urge the person \n\nalong. \n\nWe can keep the experience on this basic level or we can \n\ndevelop it further. We can give more complex suggestions, and \n\nstart asking questions - ‘What do you see?' ‘What is the \n\nperson doing?' ‘Can you hear anything?’ - so that the subject \n\nbegins to extend the fantasy beyond our directions. Sometimes \n\nthe meditation will allow the person to experience the archety¬ \n\npal elements in a new way. At other times it may go even \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n189 \n\nfurther; the images will transform themselves, releasing some \n\nintense awareness from inside the person. A number of times I \n\nhave led a group meditation with a elass, and afterwards have \n\nhad someone tell me that the meditation has allowed him or \n\nher to resolve some longstanding problem or emotional block. \n\nSuch breakthroughs, of course, came from the people them¬ \n\nselves. They were ready to go beyond their current state to a \n\nnew level, had been ready for some time, but could not bring \n\nthemselves to cross over. The meditation allowed them to do \n\nthis without realizing it until it had happened. \n\nMeditation can also help a person develop a deeper and \n\nmore personal sense of some particular card. Once, I did a \n\nmeditation with someone who found the Emperor a hard \n\nremote image, almost frightening, and certainly unattractive. \n\nI began by setting the scene for her - a stony desert by a \n\nnarrow image. This then opened out to a vast plain filled with \n\nthe Emperor’s subjects. When 1 pushed her to describe these \n\npeople she saw them all hooded - that is, faceless - and bent \n\nover, working on robot-like tasks. The Emperor's fierce \n\nexpression kept the people from daring to look at him. The \n\npeople symbolized the woman, and her unwillingness to go \n\nmore deeply into the card. \n\nI then told the woman to do just that - not just look at the \n\nEmperor but go right up to him. When her fantasy-self did \n\nthis a strange thing happened. The Emperor changed from a \n\ndespot to a kind of harmless puppet, w'hile from behind him \n\nrose a vast ghost or spirit figure, beautiful and benevolent. The \n\nwoman’s fear and reaction against the social structure of the \n\nEmperor had given way to a sense of the spiritual structure \n\nunderlying the universe. \n\nThis experience not only gave the woman a much greater \n\nsense of the Emperor’s deeper significance; it had the same \n\neffect on me. With her I went beyond the image of the \n\nEmperor as society to the more occult meaning of the card as \n\nsymbolizing the cosmos itself. Whenever we give someone a \n\nmeditation we take part in it ourselves. \n\nAt the same time, we can only lead such an exercise with \n\nanother person after we have gained some experience our¬ \n\nselves. If you are a beginner in meditation you should realize \n\nabove all that meditation tends to work better the more you do \n\nit. If you have never tried it before, it may have a powerful \n\neffect the first time you try. More likely, however, you will find \n\n190 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nit difficult to concentrate, or will simply become physically \n\nuncomfortable trying to sit without moving. Keep at it, and if \n\npossible go to a teacher for lessons in such basics as breathing \n\nand posture. \n\nI am not going to recommend any specific techniques for \n\nputting yourself into a meditative state. There are a great \n\nmany books and classes on this subject, and many people will \n\nfind they need to try a few before they find the best method \n\nthat works best for them. Though most of these techniques \n\nwill adapt themselves to work with Tarot, those which involve \n\nvisualization (as compared to those emphasizing chanting or \n\ntotal emptiness of mind) will transfer most easily. \n\nDifferent people use different methods to bring the card into \n\ntheir meditations. Some start with the eyes closed and do not \n\nlook at the card until they have reached a certain state; others \n\ndo the opposite. They begin by staring at the card until they \n\nreach a certain unity with it, then close their eyes and let the \n\nimages continue from there. Others hold the card at arm's \n\nlength, then draw it slowly towards the solar plexus, ‘bringing \n\nit into the aura'. \n\nHowever you begin I recommend working with the images \n\nand the feelings arising from the card instead of the symbolism \n\nyou have learned to associate with it. Let the picture affect \n\nyou, allow your reactions to it to surface and then slide away \n\nfrom you before they block any further experience. I have \n\nsometimes found it useful to stare without focussing at the \n\ncard, so that the symbols and forms dissolve into colour and \n\nshape. \n\nAt other times, particularly when giving a meditation to \n\nsomeone else, I will ignore the actual picture and suggest some \n\nscene associated with it. For instance, for the Fool, instead of \n\nthat particular person in his multi-coloured suit, I will use a \n\nsimpler image of a mountain top and clear sunlight. It is more \n\nimportant to set the person, or yourself, in the scene than to \n\nfollow the card exactly. \n\nMovement or posture can also help to evoke some cards. \n\nFor the Magician you might stand or sit with one arm raised \n\n‘towards heaven’ and the other pointing at the earth. \n\nSometimes the meditation will go nu further than an \n\nawareness of the card, or a discovery of new ideas about it, \n\nand about your self. At other times you will find yourself \n\n‘entering’ the card, that is, finding yourself within the image, \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n191 \n\nacting out some situation with the figures in the picture. This \n\nmay happen overwhelmingly, so that you find your whole \n\nbeing there instead of here. More likely you will experience it as \n\na fantasy unrolling before you, with an awareness at the same \n\ntime of yourself sitting on the floor or lying on the bed. Either \n\nway, it is difficult to describe in words these intense \n\nexperiences. They carry both a personal and archetypal \n\nmeaning, for while the cards bear pictures of deepest meaning, \n\nwhat we do with those images comes out of our own needs and \n\nexperiences. \n\nVarious people, such as F. D. Ouspensky and Joseph \n\nD’Agostino, have attempted to write down their own Tarot \n\nmeditations as an example or guide. For me these descriptions \n\ndo not really convey the experience of the card coming alive, of \n\nbecoming a part of the picture. Each person will experience \n\ndifferent things in these moments. For instance, with Strength \n\nyou might find yourself running with the lion, or else the \n\nwoman’s flowering wreath might wrap around you, or you \n\nmight become the woman herself or the lion; or even, as \n\nhappened to me once, the woman might release the lion to \n\nleap at you and claw and bite you. \n\nHere are some more hints. If you do not have a particular \n\nimage you wish to work with, you can do a reading or simply \n\ngo through the deck until a card grips you and pulls you into \n\nit. Then place it before you and begin with your normal \n\nmeditation. Become aware of the picture, putting aside any \n\nideas you might have about it. Keep your eyes closed or \n\nopened, depending on what works for you; most people find \n\nthat at least when the fantasy starts they prefer their eyes \n\nclosed. Try to see and feel yourself in that place with those \n\npeople and animals. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, if you are giving a meditation to \n\nsomeone else you should give them suggestions to get them \n\ninvolved with the image. You may find, after some experi¬ \n\nments, that you want to use such suggestions on yourself. For \n\nthe Hanged Man I often use the image of climbing a great \n\ntree, stopping at different levels to look at the land and the sea \n\nbeneath me, the sky and the stars above. Or you might simply \n\nwant a description of the card that you can listen to with your \n\neyes closed. If you wish to use such guides you might find it \n\nvaluable to make a tape ahead of time so that your conscious \n\nmind does not have to occupy itself with remembering what \n\n192 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\ncomes next. Try to time the tape so that you leave enough \n\nsilent spaces for yourself to react. You might include the \n\nopening of the meditation on the tape, instructing yourself to \n\nrelax, breathe deeply, etc. or you might simply leave a long \n\nsilence. Either way, most people prefer to turn the tape on at \n\nthe beginning and let the instructions come on without their \n\nhaving to make a conscious decision. You can, of course, use \n\nthe same cassette over and over again, preparing cues for diffe¬ \n\nrent cards. Or you might make a general tape, with instruc¬ \n\ntions about relaxing, merging with the card, and so on. \n\nAbove all, do not try to direct or control what will emerge. \n\nThis holds for meditations you give to others as well as for \n\nyourself. There is a fine line here. Too little direction and the \n\nperson’s attention will drift away; too much and you will not \n\nallow the subject's imagination to create its own world. As \n\nwith other situations, experience is the best guide. For both \n\nyourself and others, try not to anticipate, and not to fear, what \n\nyou experience. Most people do not respect their imaginations \n\nenough. They think they can understand whatever their \n\nimaginations show them. If they see sudden images of \n\nmonsters, or devils, or death, they think it means something \n\nterrible coming from inside themselves, something they do not \n\nwish to face. But the imagination is far more subtle than that. \n\nIt works in its own way, by its own rules. Often w'hat seems \n\ndisturbing at first will transform into something inspiring. \n\nJung called the imagination ‘the organ of the unconscious’. If \n\nyou give it its head it will take you where your conscious mind \n\nwould not have thought - or dared - to go. \n\nAll this holds true especially for the Gate cards, as well as \n\nthe Major ones. Their wordless quality of Strangeness leads us \n\nfar beyond the literal meanings associated with them. At the \n\nsame time, because they do represent certain qualities they \n\ncan also help us achieve those qualities. If it helps to carry a \n\ncard around it helps even more to carry a Major or Gate card. \n\nThey are powerful images, with an effect all their own. The \n\nact of looking at the Nine of Pentacles, letting it sink into you, \n\nhelps to create discipline, just as carrying and looking at the Six \n\nof Pentacles or the High Priestess will help you focus your \n\nawareness in a receptive way. \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n193 \n\nCREATING A ‘MANDALA’ \n\nSo far, we have considered ways to bring the influence of \n\nsingle cards into our lives. But a reading contains many cards \n\nwhich work together. To make a reading come alive, I have \n\nfound it valuable to create what I call a ‘mandala' - a pattern \n\nformed from several cards. These cards can include not only \n\nthose from the reading but others whose qualities will support \n\nthe direction the reading advises. This act of deliberately \n\nadding cards not in the reading extends again the balance \n\nbetween the conscious and the unconscious. The reading has \n\nreached into the unconscious areas of knowledge to present a \n\npicture of the situation as it exists now. Through the mandala, \n\nand through the introduction of new cards deliberately taken \n\nfrom the deck, we can extend or transform the situation. \n\nHere is an example of a mandala in which no extra cards \n\nwere necessary. The reading itself provided all the images we \n\nneeded. The following Work Cycle (Fig. 64) concerned a \n\nwoman w'ho felt isolated from the people around her despite \n\nseveral apparently good friendships. \n\nThe Cross illustrated the situation perfectly: Two of \n\nPentacles crossed by Six of Swords. It showed her central \n\nsituation of pretending to enjoy life and relations with others \n\n(Two of Pentacles) producing a sense of functioning (‘the \n\nswords do not weigh down the boat’) while she remained \n\nunable to connect with the people around her. She remained \n\nlike the woman in the boat, wrapped in her shroud, silent. \n\nBriefly, I interpreted the other cards as follows. The I lermit \n\nreversed in the position of Past Experience showed the reality \n\nof the friendships. At the same time, comparing it with the \n\nHigh Priestess at the end, it suggested she had not learned to \n\nuse her sense of aloneness creatively, to develop her in¬ \n\ndividuality. The Eight of Swords reversed as the Expectations \n\nshowed a desire to understand herself and the situation, \n\nthereby becoming free of it. It also reflected the political side \n\nof the problem, for a good deal of the woman’s isolation came \n\nfrom being a member of a minority group, with experiences \n\nnot shared by any of her friends. At a certain level she was \n\nalone. But instead of appreciating her uniqueness among the \n\npeople around her she allowed herself to hide her own \n\nexperiences in an attempt to blend in. \n\nThe three Work cards were King of Wands reversed, Death \n\njp \n\n•1 \n\n1 ■. \n\n! \n\nHOW TO USE TAROT READINGS \n\n195 \n\nreversed, and Ten of Pentacles reversed. The fact that every \n\ncard so far had come up reversed, and yet several - such as \n\nEight of Swords reversed - invited a positive reading, showed \n\nthe need for change. The King described an attitude to take \n\ntowards herself and others; strong minded, yet tolerant of con¬ \n\nfusion and weakness. Death reversed, as inertia, indicated a \n\ndanger in doing nothing. The need to turn it right side up \n\nbecame emphasized when we compared it with the Six of \n\nSwords above it. That card shows a journey modelled on the \n\njourney of dead souls. To release herself from the boat of isola¬ \n\ntion, the sense of a half-life, she would have to complete her \n\njourney by ‘dying’; that is, let go of the personality that had \n\naccustomed itself to superficial relationships and inner isola¬ \n\ntion. The Ten of Pentacles reversed indicated that to do this \n\nshe would have to gamble with the security of her current \n\nsituation and push her comfortable but limited friendships to \n\nmore intense levels. \n\nThe Ace of Swords, as the Outcome card showed the strong \n\nattitude as well as the sharp perceptive mind she would need, \n\nand find, to open up the current situation. The Result of this \n\nOutcome, the Eight of Wands, indicated the success of the \n\ngamble. The card carries suggestions of love and friendship. It \n\nsymbolizes a journey - the spiritual boat-trip - coming to an \n\nend. Most directly, it signifies the Eight of Swords repression \n\ntransformed into positive energy. \n\nWe then turned over five more cards in a pattern of three \n\nbelow the Work cards, then one and one below the Centre. \n\n(There was no special reason for doing this instead of laying \n\nout another line. It was simply an intuitive choice - one that \n\nproved worthwhile.) The three cards gave more attitudes and \n\napproaches to the situation. First, the Wheel of Fortune \n\nreversed indicated the changes she wished to make. The \n\nreversed position suggested difficulties and reinforced the risk \n\nelement of the Ten of Pentacles (remember that the Wheel is \n\nalso 10). The Four of Pentacles came below Death reversed. It \n\nimplied both the idea of releasing energy and of keeping a \n\nstructure in her life while she challenged the pattern of her \n\nfriendships. The third card continued this meaning. Coming \n\nbelow the Ten of Pentacles reversed, the Ten of Cups insisted \n\nthat while the woman took these risks she must keep an \n\nawareness of the genuine love her friends felt for her. It \n\nreferred also to the idea that she must not doubt the person \n\n196 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nshe lived with, for there she received total support and should \n\nanswer this gift with trust. \n\nThe High Priestess indicated that in a certain sense she \n\nwould remain alone, for the people around her would still not \n\nshare her background and experiences. The silence of the \n\nHigh Priestess, however, is not the silence of the Six of Swords. \n\nAlthough silent to others, the High Priestess hints at a strong \n\ninner communication, an acceptance and knowledge of the \n\nself that a person cannot express in concrete rational terms to \n\nother people. The card spoke especially to the woman, who \n\nwas a poet and had recently written a poem using the \n\nmetaphor of a private language to express just this idea of \n\ndeep knowledge available only to oneself. \n\nBelow the High Priestess came the Empress, the other side \n\nof the feminine archetype. As in the Major Arcana, the two \n\ncards complemented each other, for the Empress signified a \n\npassionate involvement with life and friendship, not as an \n\nopposition to the High Priestess's inner awareness but as a \n\nresult of it. From a position of self-acceptance the woman \n\ncould give herself openly to the people around her. \n\nWith such a powerful reading the woman wanted to work \n\nfurther with the images. We therefore constructed a mandala \n\nfor use in meditation and study (see Fig. 65). We began with \n\nDeath as the centre, for the transformation remained the key. \n\nBelow Death came the High Priestess on the left, signifying \n\nthe fact that inner communication must accompany the \n\nprocess for Death to produce real results. The Ace of Swords \n\non the right, stood for sharpness of mind. The Empress went \n\nabove, to bring about the desired new way of relating to the \n\noutside world. \n\nWe next placed cards in the four corners around the \n\nstructure, beginning with the Six of Swords and the Eight of \n\nWands in the bottom left and right. The cards showed the \n\njourney and its hoped for end. For the top corners we used the \n\nEight of Swords reversed and the King of Wands reversed - \n\nthe desired action and the attitude needed to produce it. \n\nFinally, as ‘legs’ for the mandala, we placed the Ten of Cups \n\nbelow the Eight of Wands, and the Ten of Pentacles reversed \n\nbelow the Six of Swords. The images then looked like this: \n\n198 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nIf you have a set of Rider Tarot cards arrange them as in the \n\ndiagram and look at it for a while. Notice that for meditation \n\nyou can concentrate on one card, such as Death in the centre, \n\nor let the entire pattern sink into the mind, perhaps moving \n\nthe images about. Since the mandala contains all the \n\nelements, with the trumps in the middle, the woman could \n\nmaintain balance by taking the image into herself. \n\nIf you study such an arrangement new relationships emerge \n\nbetween the cards. The Eight of Swords and Eight of Wands \n\nare obvious partners; so are the Ten of Cups and Ten of \n\nPentacles reversed. But the Eight of Wands and the King of \n\nWands reversed will also provide new meanings when we \n\nconsider them together, as do the Eight of Swords reversed \n\nand the Six of Swords. Because we have reshaped the reading \n\ninto a geometric pattern we can draw lines, triangles, etc., \n\nconstantly discovering new ideas and new patterns. In a way \n\nthe mandala creates new readings from the same images. \n\nTo construct such a pattern, choose the most important \n\ncards from the reading and work from the centre out, trying to \n\nbuild the image organically. Place the cards needed for \n\nsupport at the bottom and the cards symbolizing goals at the \n\ntop. Do not hesitate to introduce cards not found in the \n\noriginal reading if you find a strong need for qualities these \n\ncards represent. If you see a need for Temperance, for \n\ninstance, place it below the centre; or if the reading shows a \n\nneed for more developed will-power and discipline you might \n\nplace the Chariot and the Nine of Pentacles side by side above \n\nthe mandala, as the goal. In this way, you take charge of the \n\nreading, opening it to include what your intuition tells you the \n\nperson needs.",

And those who \n\nfollow a series of readings will see them as a method of keeping \n\nin harmony with the changing patterns of life. But to spend a \n\nlong time reading cards for yourself and others is to discover \n\nmany things beyond personal information. \n\nWe have already seen some of these things. One is people's \n\npessimistic reactions to readings. Another, more important, is \n\nthe way Tarot readings require - and therefore create - a balance \n\nbetween subjective and objective, intuitive and rational, \n\nimmediate impression and established knowledge, right and \n\nleft side of the brain. We cannot create such a balance simply \n\nby wanting it. We have to let it grow. Tarot readings can help \n\nthis happen. \n\nBut the Tarot teaches us other things as well. It teaches us \n\nto pay attention. As we begin to learn the ways in which \n\npeople act, and the ways in which the world acts on them, we \n\nbecome more and more in the habit of noticing what others do \n\nand what we do ourselves. Suppose a person becomes ill \n\nwhenever a holiday approaches. This could go on for years \n\nwithout the person making the connection and seeing all those \n\nillnesses as a subconscious trick to avoid some problem or fear \n\nassociated with holidays. A Tarot reading can make the \n\nperson aware of this problem - and makes the reader aware of \n\nyet another example of subconscious manoeuvring, just the \n\npractice of reading the Tarot will help us observe these tricks \n\nof behaviour, in ourselves as well as in others. \n\nOnce we start paying attention to what we do and what \n\nhappens as a result we notice all sorts of things, not just \n\n200 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nthrough readings, but in daily life; patterns of anger and trust, \n\nhope and fear, how our response to situations may come from \n\ninside us rather than from the situation itself. We become \n\nmore conscious of the way we deal with work and friends, of \n\ntendencies to shift responsibility either away from ourselves \n\n(It's not fair' or ‘You did this to me’) or onto ourselves (‘It's all \n\nmy fault ’). We will notice, for instance, that saying ‘It's all my \n\nfault’ is often a trick to avoid seeing what we have actually \n\ndone. By making it all or nothing, we make it easy to avoid a \n\ntrue assessment of the situation. \n\nPaying attention makes it just a little bit harder to get \n\ndepressed or to manipulate other people. As we begin to \n\nobserve the subtle reasons why people cry or become angry or \n\naccuse others, vve will at least know a little about ourselves \n\nwhen we do these things. \n\nTarot readings make us aware of the wonderful variety of \n\nhuman nature. As the same cards come up in endless different \n\ncombinations it becomes clear that people can always produce \n\nsomething new. At the same time, the newness will always \n\ncome on top of underlying patterns. Through readings we \n\nlearn in general the ways in which the past affects people, the \n\nways in which their hopes and fears help create the future. But \n\nspecific past situations and future expections - these will \n\nalways surprise us. \n\nHere again we learn the habit of paying attention. For if we \n\nstart interpreting the cards automatically on the basis of \n\nauthoritative books or past readings then we lose the truth, \n\nand the readings become shallow and confused. Keep a book \n\nof past readings, yes, but not simply to use it as examples for \n\nfuture work. Instead, the book can help remind us of the \n\nvariety and the constant newness of human behaviour. \n\nNotice that, as in creating balance, the Tarot does not \n\nsimply help us to pay attention. It forces us to do so if we want \n\nour readings to produce good results. Tarot readings act as a \n\nkind of psychic exercise programme which strengthens the \n\nperceptive muscles. \n\nWhat people do with the information they get from Tarot \n\nreadings teaches us some important lessons about free will. \n\nMany people look on the question of free will as an absolute. \n\nEither we make constant choices or we act according to \n\ndestiny. To give it a more modern context, do we do what we \n\ndo as a deliberate choice at that moment, or as a result of a \n\nWHAT WE LEARN FROM TAROT READINGS \n\n201 \n\nlifetime (or many lifetimes) of conditioning? \n\nIn terms of Tarot this becomes a practical question. If 1 act \n\nfreely at any moment, then how can the cards predict what I \n\nwill do? What meaning can the reading have if my choice \n\nremains totally open until the moment I do something? Or \n\ndoes some power force me to act the way the cards predict? \n\nThese problems become easier if we give up the absolute all- \n\nor-nothing approach to the question. Then we can say yes, we \n\nalways retain free will, but we rarely use it. Our conditioning, \n\nour past experience, above all our ignorance of all these \n\nthings, tend to manipulate us in certain directions. The \n\nreading reflects these influences and shows their likely result. \n\nThe cards do not compel the situation to turn out in a certain \n\nway. They simply reflect the way in which the influences \n\ncombine in real life. We can make a diffferent decision when \n\nthe time comes to act. And yet we do not. Over and over again \n\nin life, with little conscious knowledge, we surrender our \n\nfreedom of choice. We allow our history and conditioning to \n\nmove us. We do this partly from ignorance, and partly from \n\nlaziness. It is much easier to follow conditioning than to act on \n\ntruly conscious decisions. \n\nWhen I ‘failed to follow good advice', when I said to myself, \n\n‘Now that I’ve done the reading I can make sure those bad \n\nthings won’t happen’, when I went ahead with my original \n\nplan so that the predicted problems arose, I demonstrated \n\nhow I did not use my free will. I avoided it at the same time \n\nthat I pretended to be acting on it. This sort of thing happens \n\nagain and again, and the act of doing Tarot readings shows us \n\nvery vividly the ways in which people deny their freedom. It is \n\nthis relationship between freedom and conditioning which \n\nforms one of the most valuable pieces of knowledge the Tarot \n\ncan give us. \n\nThe Tarot teaches us as well the valuable lesson of context. \n\nNo matter how absolute a quality may seem to us in the \n\nabstract, in reality it affects us only in the context of other \n\ninfluences. Readings demonstrate this fact in a practical way, \n\nas with the woman trying to deal with her lover’s jealousy. A \n\ncard usually thought of as positive, the Sun, actually tended \n\ntowards a bad result, for by hoping for the Sun she did not \n\nface the needs of the situation, and in fact allowed other \n\npeople’s ideas to dictate what she wanted. \n\nAlong with context we learn the ways in which the elements \n\n202 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nof life balance each other. We see first of all how the suits and \n\nspecific cards combine to form a unified situation with no suit \n\nbetter or worse than any of the others. Astrologers often find \n\nthat clients hope for certain signs and elements to dominate \n\ntheir charts, and will show disappointment or even shame if \n\nothers appear. \n\nSimilarly, for some people who know a little about Tarot, if \n\na reading shows a lot of Wands, or Cups, they will feel comfor¬ \n\nted; if it showed Swords they will become frightened; and if it \n\nshows Fentacles they will think of it as trivial, even insulting. \n\nSome will only accept a reading which contains many Major \n\ncards, because only the trumps, with their implications of \n\npower and spiritual awareness, appear important to them. \n\nBut even the Major Arcana forms only one element, \n\nmeaningless without the others. We study it in isolation for its \n\nwisdom and powerful description of existence. But in practice \n\nwe need to mix the spiritual with the mundane, the happy \n\nwith the sad, love and anger together to understand the world. \n\nThe cards teach yet another balance, one hinted at in the \n\nscales of justice. How does the past relate to the future \n\npossibilities? How do we combine the effects of our own \n\ndecision with the influences of the outside world ? What do we \n\nmean when we say we take responsibility for our lives? Does it \n\nmean we create or control everything that happens to us? As \n\nin the case of free will many people like to think of respon¬ \n\nsibility in an absolute way. Either the world shapes us \n\nentirely, or we retain total control over our lives. Tarot \n\nreadings drive home the point that a person’s situation at any \n\nmoment derives from a combination of these things. Just as a \n\nvery short person cannot expect to become a professional \n\nbasketball player, so that same person must not consider his \n\nwhole life dominated by height. \n\nPeople who accept this idea in theory may still ask: Which \n\ncounts most - situation or personal responsibility? Which one \n\nreally controls a person? But Tarot readings demonstrate the \n\nmeaninglessness of this and similar questions. In some \n\nreadings the position of Self or Hopes and Fears will clearly \n\ndominate. In others Basis or Environment will prove the \n\ndetermining factors. It depends on the person and the par¬ \n\nticular situation. \n\nTarot readings help us develop confidence in our own \n\nperceptions. Partly this comes from the knowledge gained, \n\nWHAT WE LEARN FROM TAROT READINGS \n\n203 \n\nand partly from the need to make choices and stick by them. \n\nWhich of a card’s meanings applies in a particular case? Does \n\na court card apply to the subject, some other person, or an \n\nabstract principle, such as the King of Swords signifying law \n\nand authority, or the Queen of Cups creativity? As we read \n\nmore we find ourselves starting to sense the answers to these \n\nand similar questions. As a result we gain more trust in our \n\nunderstanding and intuition. \n\nWhat period does a reading cover? With the Celtic Cross or \n\nthe Work Cycles, the answer can range from a few days to \n\nyears, not just forwards, but backwards as well. Sometimes, \n\nfor an adult, the reading can reach back to childhood. The \n\nTree of Life, too, though it usually shows an overview of the \n\nwhole life, can sometimes show a shorter period if the person \n\nis going through a time of intense change. \n\nThe different periods of time covered especially in the \n\nshorter readings, depend on two things. First, the person's \n\nsituation and the question asked. Some things, practical or \n\nlegal matters and certain emotional situations, can bring forth \n\nan answer that makes itself apparent within a few days. With \n\nothers - the working out of emotional conflicts, deep relation¬ \n\nships, spiritual or artistic development - it can take a long \n\ntime before the reading fulfils itself. This does not mean that \n\nthe readings will not ‘come true’ for years. We are not \n\nspeaking of predictions, but of continuing patterns that slowly \n\nunfold as time passes. \n\nSecond, the different levels a person may touch when \n\nmixing the cards. Sometimes he or she may evoke surface \n\nsituations which last only a short time. At other times the \n\nperson may mix the cards and somehow go to the very centre \n\nof experience. And even here, the reading may show the deep \n\npast, or it may reflect the person’s potential for future develop¬ \n\nment. \n\nThe level reached may not depend at all on the attitude of \n\nthe person mixing the cards. Usually this approach does make \n\na difference. Someone who sees a reading as a joke or a game \n\nwill most likely produce a shallow reading; the person who \n\nthinks deeply of a question, mixes the cards carefully, and \n\ntries to sense the exact moment to stop and cut the deck, will \n\nusually produce a reading of some significance. Yet sometimes \n\neven such a careful approach will not go below the surface \n\nevents of the immediate future, w'hile at other times the most \n\n204 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\ncasual shuffler will suddenly find her or himself confronted \n\nwith a powerful image of an entire life. For the reader such \n\nmoments carry an intense excitement \n\nEven the question itself may not matter. People can ask \n\nabout how their work is going, and receive an answer about \n\ntheir new- love affair, especially if that question occupies their \n\nmind more than the one they asked. Or, as in the case of the \n\nwoman who found her sexuality blocked by conflicts with her \n\nfather, the reading may answer the question by bringing up \n\nunexpected material from some other area. \n\nHow do we know, then, what the reading tells us’ J Some \n\nthings become obvious from the images of the cards. If we ask \n\nabout w’ork and the Lovers and the Two of Cups appear, then \n\nthe reading will probably concern not work but love. As a \n\nbeginning reader, however, you cannot expect to uncover all \n\nsubtleties. Experience alone will help you find your way to the \n\nheart of the labyrinth. As you continue w ith readings you will \n\nfind yourself able to sense these things. And the heightened \n\nperception will carry over to other areas of your life as well. \n\nSometimes, no matter what our experience or the sharpness \n\nof our intuition, we will make mistakes. We might look at the \n\nLovers symbolically when it predicts a love affair with a \n\nperson the subject still has not met. From this inability to \n\nknow exactly what the cards mean we can actually learn a \n\nvery valuable lesson. We become aw'are of Ignorance. I have \n\ncapitalized this term because of its essential quality. While \n\nmost of the knowledge we build up in life is really quite \n\nsuperficial and external, Ignorance lies at the very base of our \n\nexistence. First of all, we are ignorant of the true nature of \n\nthings. What we know of the w'orld is bounded by our sense \n\norgans. For us to see the words on this page, light must \n\nbounce off them to be collected by our eyes. Then the optic \n\nnerve carries impulses to the brain, which converts the \n\nimpulses into others, arranging them into meaningful patterns \n\nour consciousness understands as language. But we cannot \n\ndirectly know, in the sense of merging with something out \n\nthere. We can only convert the universe into impulses, \n\npatterns, symbols. \n\nSimilarly, because we exist in physical form, we must w'ork \n\nout our lives in the boundaries of time. This means, among \n\nother things, that we cannot realize all our potential, because \n\nwe must always choose to do one thing and not another with \n\nWHAT WE LEARN FROM TAROT READINGS \n\n205 \n\nthe few' years available to us. A person with the ability to \n\nbecome both a dancer and a businessman will have to choose \n\none over the other. And which ever he chooses he will have to \n\nwork for years before he can actually achieve his goal, l ime \n\nmeans also that we often cannot know the consequences of \n\nactions we take, simply because the consequences might not \n\nappear until years in the future. Sometimes the consequences \n\nof our actions appear not to us but to other people. Something \n\nwe do in a certain place may affect people there long after we \n\nhave moved, or even died. Quite simply, time means things \n\nmust happen before we can know about them. \n\nMeditation with the Eight of Swords as a Gate can increase \n\nour awareness of Ignorance. Tarot readings - and the \n\nmistakes we make as we try to interpret them - can demon¬ \n\nstrate Ignorance more directly. A Tarot reading actually \n\nreaches beyond time, bringing out the true pattern that \n\nincludes past and future. The random pattern of the cards \n\nleads us to bypass the limitations of consciousness. And yet \n\nthat limited consciousness must interpret the reading. \n\nTherefore, at one and the same time, w-e experience the true \n\nstate of the universe, in which all things exist together, and our \n\nowm extremely limited lime-bound knowledge of it. We \n\nexperience both truth and ignorance. \n\nThe other side of Ignorance is Certitude, the state of \n\nknowing reality, rather than the impressions and symbols our \n\nlimited consciousness forms from it. Many people consider \n\necstasy, or oneness with the light of God, as the supreme goal \n\nof the mystic or occultist. But as the Major Arcana of the \n\nTarot demonstrates, the lightning bolt of ecstasy forms only a \n\nstep along the way. 'The true goal is Certitude, the state of \n\nknowing where before we could only guess. \n\nWhat is the real cause of any single action? What will its \n\nconsequences be, not just to the person who has acted, but to \n\nothers, both known and unknown? Those few people who \n\nhave achieved Certitude can see the causes and consequences \n\nwithin the action itself. The rest of us can only guess about \n\nthese and a thousand other things. We remain Ignorant. \n\nBut even if we cannot guess at the true interpretation of a \n\nTarot reading, the reading itself reaches beyond that time- \n\nbound Ignorant state. The reading carries Certitude, if not the \n\nreader. And if we work enough with cards, comparing our \n\ninterpretations with subsequent events, becoming more and \n\n206 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nmore involved with the pictures, developing our intuition, then \n\nsometimes we can get experiences of Certitude, of knowing the \n\ntrue meaning of something. While such experiences carry \n\ntheir own value, they serve us most by giving us a sense of \n\ndirection. They help us perceive what we want to achieve. \n\nFinally, the practice of Tarot reading teaches us something \n\nelse. Because the cards arc not neutral in their attitude to life, \n\nbecause they embody certain approaches and beliefs, and \n\nrenounce others, they change us. We begin over time - always \n\nover time - to see the balance of things, the steady harmony \n\nwithin the constant shift and flow of life. We become aware of \n\nthe Strangeness always waiting beyond our ordinary \n\nexperience, we learn to recognize the gifts we receive from \n\nexistence, and our own responsibility to understand and use \n\nthem. Most of all, we begin to grasp the truth the Tarot \n\nalways urges upon us - that the universe the whole universe, \n\nlives. And what we can know of ourselves we can know of \n\neverything. \n\nIndex \n\nAdam and Eve 25, 94 \n\nAir, element of (see Swords) \n\nAir of Water 51 \n\nBook o/Thoth, The 124 \n\nBuilders of the Adytum deck 9 \n\nCase, Paul Foster 11 \n\nCeltic Cross reading, The 140- \n\n158,147 \n\nSample reading 151-158,152 \n\nCrowley deck 7, 8, 9, 124, 137 \n\nCups 48-70 \n\nKing of 50-51 \n\nQueen of 52-53 \n\nKnight of 54-55 \n\nPage of 56-57 \n\nTen of 20, 48,57-58 \n\nNine of 58-59 \n\nEight of 59-61 \n\nSeven of 61-62 \n\nSix of 62-63 \n\nFive of 63-64 \n\nFour of 65 \n\nThree of 66-67 \n\nTwo of 67-68 \n\nAce of 69 \n\nDeath card 54, 55, 85 \n\nDevil, The 110 \n\nDivination; Introduction to 123- \n\n135 \n\nTypes of Readings 136-181 \n\nUse of 182-206 \n\nEarth, element of (see Pentacles) \n\nEmperor, The 73, 74 \n\nEmpress, The 43 \n\nFire, element of (see Wands) \n\nFire of Fire 32 \n\nFire of Water 55 \n\nFool, The 67, 68, 84, 96.97, 104 \n\nGarden of Eden 25 \n\nGate cards 20-21,43, 60, 64, 82, \n\n85,95, 102, 104, 109, 112, \n\n120, 192 \n\nGolden Dawn, Order of 10, 39, \n\n55,89 \n\nGrail, The 57, 66, 69, 70, 88 \n\nHanged Man 84, 135 \n\nHeh (see Tetragrammaton) \n\nHermes 68 \n\nHermit, The 59, 60, 64, 120 \n\nHierophant, The 110, 113, 114 \n\nHigh Priestess 90, 91, 134 \n\nJustice card 73, 74, 76, 102, 111, \n\n135 \n\nKing Arthur 69, 70 \n\nKundalini 25 \n\nLovers, The 67, 68, 110 \n\nMagician, The 98. 118, 134 \n\nMandala 193-197 \n\nMarseilles pack 7, 8 \n\nMeditation 187-192 \n\nMoroccan Tarot 11 \n\nOuspensky, P.D. 19 \n\nPentacles 94-120 \n\nKing of 96-97 \n\nQueen of 98-99 \n\nKnight of 99-100 \n\n\\ \n\n208 \n\nSEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM \n\nPage of 101 \n\nTen of 102-104 \n\nNine of 105-106 \n\nEight of 107-108 \n\nSeven of 108 \n\nSix of 109-113 \n\nFive of 113-115 \n\nFour of 11,115-116 \n\nThree of 117-118 \n\nTwo of 118-119 \n\nAce of 119-120 \n\nPictorial Key, The 84, 124, 137 \n\nQabalah 9, 170, 171, 172, 173 \n\nQuerent 136 \n\nRider pack (background to) 7- \n\n12 \n\nSephiroth 9, 170, 171 \n\nSignificator card 138, 139, 140, \n\n160, 173 \n\nSmith, Pamela Colman 7, 8, 10, \n\n84 \n\nStrength 118 \n\nSwords 71-93 \n\nKing of 73-75 \n\nQueen of 75-76 \n\nKnight of 71, 77 \n\nPage of 78-79 \n\nTen of 79-80 \n\nNine of 80-81 \n\nEight of 82-83 \n\nSeven of 83-84 \n\nSix of 84-86 \n\nFive of 86-87 \n\nFour of 87-88 \n\nThree of 89-90 \n\nTwo of 12, 90-91 \n\nAce of 92-93 \n\nSynchronicity 130, 132 \n\nTemperance card 140 \n\nTetragrammaton 14, 17-19 \n\nTower, The 41, 42 \n\nTree of Life 9, 25, 102, 126 \n\nTree of Life reading, The 169- \n\n181,173 \n\nVav (see Tetragrammaton) \n\nVisconti-Sforza deck 12 \n\nWaite, Arthur Edward 7, 8, 12, \n\n29, 37, 45, 47, 50, 53, 59, \n\n66,78,81,84, 90, 101, 111, \n\n119, 124 \n\nWands 25-47 \n\nKing of 27-29 \n\nQueen of 30-31 \n\nKnight of 31-32 \n\nPage of 33-34 \n\nTen of 34-35 \n\nNine of 36-37 \n\nEight of 3 7-38 \n\nSeven of 38-39 \n\nSix of 39-40 \n\nFive of 40-41 \n\nFour of 41-42 \n\nThree of 43-44 \n\nTwo of 45-46 \n\nAce of 46-47 \n\nWater, element of (see Cups) \n\nWheel of Fortune 135 \n\nWork Cycle reading, The 158- \n\n169,161 \n\nSample reading 165-169,166, \n\n168 \n\nYod (see Tetragrammaton), 46 \n\nI",
